Interviewer: Hello. Welcome to this land talk where we talk about how local landscapes change over time. Today I'll be interviewing Nicole Dacker. [SP] We will be talking about the Hyattsville area and how it changed over the years. So, tell me, what do you remember from when you first moved here?

Interviewee: I remember lots of space, open streets, lots of trees, and cicadas. When I first moved here, it was the year of the cicadas. So, that stood out to me. 

Interviewer: Okay. What is your favorite part about living here?

Interviewee: Now?

Interviewer: Yes. 

Interviewee: Convenience. Everything is minutes away. Everything, anything you need is minutes away. 

Interviewer: What is something that you dislike about this area?

Interviewee: Now?

Interviewer: Yes. 

Interviewee: Too many people. Just people everywhere, and it didn't used to be like that. Used to have a homey feel, you know,  you knew all your neighbors and people down the street. Now, people are just everywhere that you don't know, and they're mean. 

Interviewer: What animals have you seen since you've lived here?

Interviewee: Mostly birds and squirrels. An occasional deer. I want to say I saw a fox. I don't know. It could have been a wolf. It was something, but it was not something that you see all the time. And dogs and cats. Domestic animals. Do you know what? Lots of cats. Lots of stray cats. A lot of stray cats. 

Interviewer: Would you say the same plants and trees where here back then, that are here today? Or have you seen any new type of plants since you've lived here? 

Interviewee: Not that I've cared to notice. I know that a lot of the trees that were here are gone because now there buildings there. 

Interviewer: Okay. How would you say the weather changed over the years? Or would you say it's pretty much the same?

Interviewee: The weather seems to be pretty much the same. Every now and then, there'll be a really weird storm, tornado-like even almost, you know. Once or twice there's been... Actually there was a tornado that touched down in College Park a few years ago. But other than that it's been, I guess, constant weather. 

Interviewer: Okay. What do you miss about living here?

Interviewee: What do you mean? Like, what do I miss? I mean, I still live here. 

Interviewer: Is there anything that you wish was still here that was here back then?

Interviewee: I just wish that they didn't gentrify as much as they did. You know, gentrification is one of those things that you appreciate them bringing in new stores and more options, but it's overcrowded now. I miss the Mayberry feel of Hyattsville. Now it's like one of those cities being built up like DC and New York.

Interviewer: Okay. Would you say that the change in the environment, would you say that changed your lifestyle? 

Interviewee: Yes, because it's more fast-paced now. Like I said, people are meaner, so it's more hustle and bustle on road. And you definitely have more places that entice you to spend money. Shopping habits have changed. There's something to buy everywhere. 

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you for joining my land talk.
