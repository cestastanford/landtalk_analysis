Connor: I started the recording. Okay. Hello, I'm Connor Hassen [SP] and I'm here with Joanne Hassen who is my mother. Joanne, where do you live?

Joanne: I live in Sutter Creek, California, Amador County.

Connor: Okay. And how long have you lived there?

Joanne: Twenty-three years.

Connor: All right. Great. Thank you. So, historic, like, how the appearance of the environment, how has it changed in the time that you've lived there?

Joanne: The appearance of the environment, in and of itself, there are more people up here so a lot more traffic, more stoplights. When we first moved up here, there were only... there was only one stoplight. Now I think there's probably maybe 10. A lot more traffic and a lot more people moving up here, so, and with that, a lot of the wells have gone dry. We're on a septic system, a well system. We have a well instead of city water. A lot of people living up here have kind of hurt the water cable, I guess you would say.

Connor: Has there been a lot of new developments as well?

Joanne: We don't have... there are new development. It's not like down in the city in [inaudible 00:01:25] but there are newer developments since we've been here. There's been quite a few houses being built, either individually or a couple new developments but not a lot.

Connor: All right. And, like, climate-wise, has it changed? Is it hotter temperatures or, like, less snow, and stuff like that, less trees?

Joanne: Well, climate-wise, yeah, I mean, we've had [inaudible 00:01:57] and a lot of the oak trees have lost... have fallen [inaudible 00:02:08] six acres so we've noticed that. As far as the climate, we used to get snow maybe two, three times a year. We're about [inaudible 00:02:19] kind of glad to have [inaudible 00:02:21] In the past year or two, maybe it's been three years, we haven't gotten any snow at all during the winter.

Connor: All right. Okay. And, like, activities you've done around here, are there things that you, like, don't do anymore that you used to, like [inaudible 00:02:41] the environment out on your property?

Joanne: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I think I know what you're saying. Mainly the activities have remained the same except for one of the places that we used to go called [inaudible 00:02:56] the water went off it. It's not as much so the place... the swimming pool that we used to go to has less water.

Connor: Okay. Interesting. Yeah. I think that's all the questions I have. And you send me some photos.

Joanne: I will.

Connor: Okay. All right. Cool. Thanks.

Joanne: It was nice talking to you, Connor.

Connor: All right. Goodbye, Joanne.

Joanne: Goodbye, Connor.
