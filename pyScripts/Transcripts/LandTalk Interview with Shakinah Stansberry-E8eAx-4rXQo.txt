Kinterria: Okay. This recording took place on...

Shakinah: April 24th, 2019.

Kinterria: Okay. And my full name is Kinterria Stansberry. My grade level is the 12th grade, and I'm 18 years old. And my observer that I'm going to be observing today her name, Shakinah Stansberry. Okay. And the topic we're going to discuss is how Grenada has changed from the street she used to live on called?

Shakinah: Rayford Street.

Kinterria: Okay. So my first question for you is, when you were little how was Rayford Street? Like, Was it fun?

Shakinah: Oh, my goodness. Growing up on Rayford Street was like totally amazing. I moved there from the age of seven until I was 16. And during my stay, there was the entire family lived there. So, our house was the little greenhouse on the hill, it was known as the little greenhouse the hill. My address was 1107. I remember like yesterday. Across the street from me was a great aunt. Matter of fact, everybody on the block was family. On the hill one uncle had, we had cows. On the other part, we had a little farm we would go to pick greens and peas and beans, and then on the other part we used to get mad in the summertime because we had another uncle, he had hogs and it would be stinking out there. So, we had everything we needed. Growing up my family provided us with a lot. Everybody on the hill, on the top part of the hill was family, was my grandmother's siblings. And straight across the street from our house was my great-grandmother's house.

Kinterria What was your favorite, favorite moment on Rayford Street?

Shakinah: I had so many. I can remember the best time ever, it was one Christmas and it didn't snow. It was kind of warm for Christmas. And everybody in the neighborhood either got a bike or got skates and where we live, we live like a few minutes from the school and they had re-concrete or blacktop the parking lot, and the entire community was out there in the parking lot. We was either skating, riding our bikes, and the little kids had like those little big wheels.

Kinterria: So, from when you've grown up there to now have, you seen a big change?

Shakinah: I have. Most of my family members that live there are deceased now. And it's a younger neighborhood, and not, a young, a younger group of people have moved in there and the neighborhood has not been kept. And just the family values and morals that was there because we were such a tight-knit family is no longer there.

Kinterria: So, would you, like, do you see yourself, like, if you could would you make the neighborhood if you wanted to do you think you could rebuild the neighborhood?  

Shakinah: The only reason I would say no is because it was a generation of knowledge, a generation of family that was there, and because they're not there a lot of people there now, I don't know them. So, getting acquainted with them, them understanding me and me understanding them will be a little difficult.

Kinterria So only... But I know say you had a lot of family members on that block. But who was the family member that you clinged more to on that block?

Shakinah: We called her aunt Toot, her real name was Diana [inaudible 00:04:06] She was my grandmother's oldest sister. She was like the matriarch of the family. I remember just the knowledge that I got from her understand and not being selfish. She was known as the candy lady and in the morning time, before I went to school, I would often go over there so I could get me a snack for school and also eat breakfast because she always had a full course breakfast, lunch and dinner prepared before we went to school because she made sure my uncle ate and she made sure whoever in the neighborhood needed something, she provided. And so my task was to help the kids in the mor-, rather not help, but sell her snack items to the kids before they went to school in the morning. And I can remember one young girl came and she didn't have enough money, and I said, "You don't have enough money. You can't get it." And my auntie said, "Give it to her." And I said, "But she ain't got  enough money." And my auntie said, "You never have money but you walk out with stuff." And so she was like, you know, "Treat people right," whatever. She just taught me a lot. And so I just learned to help those who needed help when they didn't have. 

Kinterria: So, while you were growing up on the street, did you learn a lot of knowledge while growing up on the street?

Shakinah: I did. As I stated before, everybody on the street were family. They were all my grandmother's sister and brother making them great auntie and my great uncle. So, I learned how to garden, I learned about slopping the pigs, I learned about feeding the cows, picking the greens. It was a lot that I learned from them. I learned a lot of history from my uncles, just a lot of knowledge was there for me.

Kinterria Okay. This concludes our interview. I want to thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Is there anything else you want to say before this interview is concluded?

Shakinah: Well, I hope everything that you asked me was answered correctly, and I hope you do well on your work assignment that you have here. 

Kinterria: Thank you. 

Shakinah: You're welcome.
