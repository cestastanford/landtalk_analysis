Interviewer: All right. Land Talk interview. Bloomington, Indiana. So, what do you remember from when you first moved here?

Interviewee: The first thing I remember was coming into Bloomington, we were driving from New York. And I was in the front seat of the moving truck with my dad and we were coming from down 37 south. And as we drove to that final hill looking over Bloomington, I remember him saying, "Well, what do you think? This is our new home." And it was really beautiful. There were all these trees and there was the overpass that went back over that goes into Walnut. And I thought it was beautiful and I still remember every time I drive down that, I remember that trip with my dad.

Interviewer: So, what type of trees were surrounding that area?

Interviewee: Well, that's a good question. It's very similar to today.

Interviewer: Okay. So, there's not been a lot of change in those?

Interviewee: Not really a lot of change. No. Matter of fact, it looks very similar to what it looked like in the late '70s. 

Interviewer: Okay. So, what type of hobbies have been picked up based on the environment around here? What has the environment forced you into activity-wise? Or lended its hand towards activity-wise?

Interviewee: Well, it's interesting. So, it's changed. We had longer winters and there was a ski resort over in Nashville and that closed. Actually, it was two ski resorts for a short period of time. Both of those have closed. I think maybe not...more because of probably bad business practice than the weather. But I think what has changed a lot has been mountain biking has been something that's pretty new. And of course, we've got a lot of mountain biking trails.

Interviewer: Okay. So, expanding on that. Have any new like parks where mountain biking have popped up? I know there's the one trail. Yeah.

Interviewee: Wapehani [SP] Park is now for mountain biking. And then a lot of trail work has been put in in Brown County State Park that was not there.

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: Dedicated to mountain biking.

Interviewer: So, along with that, what do you like about living here most now compared to then? What's changed that has lended its hand to make you like the place more?

Interviewee: Well, there's a lot of great restaurants that have come to Bloomington. So, I think when we first moved here there just weren't a lot of ethnic restaurants. So, maybe I don't even know if we had Chinese or Mexican restaurants when we first moved to Bloomington. But now we've got lots of Chinese restaurants, lots of Middle Eastern restaurants. We've got all types of different coffee shops or other places to eat, breakfast places. So, that's really terrific I think and it's a lot of fun to go out to try those different foods.

Interviewer: And so that being the thing you like most, what do you dislike most? What change has been the worst?

Interviewee: Well, it's interesting. I think one of the biggest challenges Bloomington has is it attracts people from all over. And that brings good things, it also brings bad things. So, I worry about drug abuse and things like that that are taking place in our town. And that's a big struggle because I think that that just erodes a lot of the core. So, you have to take the good with the bad. The good is you bring all this diversity and all these different thoughts together. The bad is some of the thoughts aren't that good and some of the practices aren't that good too or not that healthy for you. Put it that way.

Interviewer: Okay. Switching to more nature-themed. What type of trees and plants have you seen become more populous in this area compared to 20 years ago?

Interviewee: Yeah. Great question. So, what I note...and I'm not positive if I just notice it more or if it's been planted more but redbuds and dogwoods are now very popular in Bloomington. Of course, they're natural out in the wilderness area and it's interesting to see those being brought into town. And that's happened over 20 or 30 years. So, maybe I've just noticed it more.

Interviewer: Yeah. So, would you say so you do like those two plants coming in?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. Have you noticed any change in rain and other weather patterns like that besides just shorter winters now? 

Interviewee: No, I don't. I remember as a kid, we'd have tornadoes and we still have those today.

Interviewer: So, on that point, are there any big crazy storms that have happened in the past time that you've been here that are memorable?

Interviewee: Not necessarily. Not more so than what I think we had before.

Interviewer: Yeah. Some warnings and some big gusts of wind. Stuff like that?

Interviewee: I remember us having very hot summers and we still get those. And recently we've had... So, I think that it's a good mix of both.

Interviewer: Okay. So, last question. Why would you say you've stayed in Bloomington other than work?

Interviewee: Well, I have a lot of my core family is here.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: And it's someplace that's very familiar. So, I would say it's comfortable. And there are a lot of things that I like about this town.

Interviewer: Yeah. So, outside of family, what would you say the things are in the town and in the environment that you see, what keeps you in Bloomington besides...?

Interviewee: Yeah. So, it would be that we have all of the natural forests that are around. I spend time out in the national forest and [inaudible 00:07:25] and the state parks and on the lake. And so I enjoy all of those things.

Interviewer: All right. Awesome thank you so much.

Interviewee: You're welcome.

Interviewer: Appreciate it.
