Child: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. Who was the principal at Las Lomitas when you started teaching?

Boy: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California.

Woman 1: When I first started teaching, it was Jerry. Oh my gosh [inaudible 00:00:16]. I'll tell you his last name in a minute. And he was my first principal, and then Sue Sartor was my next principal. [inaudible 00:00:26] Traynor, Jerry Traynor. Sorry, I didn't [inaudible 00:00:33].

Boy: How has Las Lomitas changed?

Woman 2: How has Las Lomitas changed since when?

Boy: Since...

Woman 2: Since I first came?

Boy: Since you first started teaching.

Woman 2: Well, I think...

Boy: This is on a different thing. We're supposed to be... It's not on our profile.

Woman 2: Oh, it's not? Oh, it's on Lucy? Okay, so we have to stop. Stop.

Girl: We have to [inaudible 00:00:41].

Woman 1: It was only 13 years ago when I started teaching. So, Las Lomitas looked a lot like it does now, except... You see all these portables over here, where after school champions and... I don't know what's going on in that room, but none of those were here. So, that wasn't here. And, of course, all the new construction that's happening behind this big building. None of that was happening. You remember that.

Child: It couldn't be here, because, just impossible.

Woman 1: Right. It just happened. And let me think... Was that the only thing? Well, I guess all the trees were a little shorter, and all the gardens were not as filled out, you know, because trees grow every year a little bit, so it looks more green and filled in in a lot of ways.

Child: But it was mostly the same?

Woman 1: Oh, and you know what else was different? We used to have trees, maybe you remember them, along where you used to get picked up by cars on the other side of all these buildings here. There used to be trees, and that's on Camino Al Lago, and all those trees were cut down in the summer, did you notice that? Yeah, so, that has changed. But I think... Oh, and I think when I first came, the kindergarten playground didn't have as much equipment. That changed. And I think that's all the changes I remember.

Child: What did Kepler's bookstore used to look like?

Woman 1: What did what?

Child: Kepler's bookstore used to...

Woman 1: Oh, Kepler's bookstore changed a lot. Kepler's bookstore used to take up twice as much space. Do you know where it is in Menlo Park? Well, it used to be twice as big, and twice as many books.

Child: Was it two stories?

Woman 1: No, it was never two stories that I can remember. Maybe a long time ago it was, but... And then people started buying their books on Amazon and on the internet, and all the bookstores that were run by people, they couldn't keep their shops open for very long because everybody wanted to shop with the internet on Amazon and other internet services. So, at first Kepler's closed, and then everybody was so upset that it closed that it reopened and now it's just smaller. I think that's it. Are those all the questions you have for me?

Child: Yep. Thank you for sharing with us.

Woman 1: You are so welcome. It was so much fun.
