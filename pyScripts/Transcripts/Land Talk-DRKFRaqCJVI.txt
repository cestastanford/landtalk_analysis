I'm from South Florida, the east coast, and I've lived here since 1986, so over 30 years. And I've seen a lot of changes over the years, especially with the structure of the land. It used to be more undeveloped and now it's just become more modern and very populated, I think due to the ocean and the attractions here as far as Miami Beach and Orlando. I think the housing market has changed tremendously. The prices are very high here. A lot of people wanna live in the Sunshine State. There's just a lot of culture, a lot of different languages spoken. It used to look more, like, historical. All the homes and the buildings were one level and just now everything is monstrous, Titanic homes that are two, three stories that kinda takes away from the coastline views. A lot of restaurants and stores are more of a franchise as opposed to, you know, family-owned restaurants and businesses.

We have, like, a ton of iguanas here now which is very specific to South Florida. They are everywhere you would look. There's just too many of them. And years ago, we didn't have any iguanas but due to, you know, the hurricanes and just the damage that occurs after a hurricane, it's mostly with the trees and the landscaping. Structurally, the homes here were pretty sound built and they can withstand, you know, a lot of the high winds. So, yeah, well, hurricane season I believe runs from September into March and historically, we get a storm maybe every three to five years that is strong enough to do destruction. And then it takes approximately a good six months for things to get back to normal here as far as the clean up. And economically, things slow down, businesses come to a halt. So it definitely affects the land and, you know, the economy, and people just prepare better for the next storm.

Over the years, we have definitely improved. People have generators now and the structural codes have changed. So things are definitely stronger built and safer. With housing, roofs have to be strapped on with certain size nails or screws. You know, a lot of people have impact glass windows on their homes so that flying debris doesn't go through the front door or, you know, rip out a window. People have accordion hurricane shutters and it's just the building codes have changed. So garage doors are built more securely and they all have to be able to withstand a certain speed of wind to be approved, you know, by the building permission. And I think just the oceans have changed due to the pollution and then people not, you know, caring for the earth and the water. You know, there's a lot of caution now when you go into the ocean. There are health risks whereas previously, many years ago the waters were clean and blue, and you didn't have a lot of debris and trash coming up to the shore.

I used to go to a lot of art shows, street fairs, visit the ocean a lot when my children were younger and I still do, I still do it. But, you know, a lot of things have changed. You know, there's usually annual events that I do like to change that have been consistent, like, since the past 20 years. I mean, there's a lot of natural parks that have been built over the years. Once you get into the Everglades, you have to be in an airboat to get around. You know, in the '70s, in 1970, land started...the initial development was on the east side near the ocean, and now everything is just trickling towards the Everglades. So all the new construction and development is moving west, west, west, which is to the Everglades. And once they reach the Everglades, then everything will be developed and they won't have anywhere else to go. They'll have to go north. I think it's protected. Yes. I don't think they can do anything.
