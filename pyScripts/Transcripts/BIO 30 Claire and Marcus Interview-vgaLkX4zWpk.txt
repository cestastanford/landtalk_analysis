Marcus: Okay. My name is Marcus, Marcus Achatz and I am 42 and living in Australia and Silvia's former teacher in the Study Abroad program.

Silvia: Yes.

Marcus: The location we are at, we're in far north Queensland, so northwest of Kent, about seven kilometers off the coast in a place called Mount Molloy. So this property is 165-acre wildlife reserve, which is half rainforest and half dry bushland, or open forest. And when I first came here, it was pretty wild because no one had used it for anything. Actually, 80 years before me, this was a dairy farm in one section and that had all overgrown and the rainforest had reclaimed most of the land. So there were no known habitats and no habitations here. It was just really wild bushland and then I did the destructive part and had to clear room for the house. So I sort of introduced the first disturbance in about 80 years into the area. 

So, yeah, it hasn't changed hugely except for the impact I've had on it. I've tried to keep it to a minimum by only clearing the areas that we use. So we don't do any farming and such, so we haven't cleared any broad areas, it's mainly been areas which have been cleared for the house to be built, so we've got my house and my parent's house here and for the gardens surrounding the house, because as a lot of people know, in Australia, bushfires are a big risk, so you do have to clear space around your house to have fire protection. So we have a bit of lawn on one side of the house, to stop bushfires coming in and the other side of the house we don't need to because there's rainforest protecting it anyway. That's better?

Interviewer Yeah. Better.

Marcus: Yeah. And then we've got our walks and trails. And of course, there's the walking trails. We didn't just clear wherever we wanted to. We specifically put the walking trails between features of interest, so billabongs and things like that, but we avoided any special trees and disturbing any special areas. So we're very conscious of where we put them.

But one of the things which has been a by-product of our change of the way we managed the land compared to just living, the wild...let me explain. In the past, bush fires used to come through the property a lot because neighboring properties would burn by farmers lighting it and just people flooding the forest like national parks to do regular burns, and the fire would just spread through our property every three years approximately. 

With us living here, we don't want that to happen because nature can't cope with fire to such a repetitive level. So because we have walking trails and tracks going through now, we can stop fires on the property or even entering the property. And that's actually allowed the rainforest to spread. So we've got an increase of rainforest coverage now over 16 years because fires haven't been pushing the rainforest back. So that the changes we've seen have actually been a spread of rainforest in that time. 

As far as the climate goes, it is really, really variable here. So when I first came here 16 years ago, I had a really big drought where our creek dried up and I could walk my dog along the bottom of the creek for about three kilometers. That hasn't happened since, but we've had really severe droughts. But then again, we've had all this really high rainfall, so it's just really been kind of unstable, and the locals have said that, too, that the weather is more extreme now, and we notice that.

With plant and animal species, I can't say I've seen a huge change. Claire has noticed some changes with some of the wildlife here, because she's more of the animal person, I'll get her to jump on in a second. But for the me, the plants...I guess every couple of years, I do see a new type of weed come in. 

And that's because on either side of our property, there's farming. So there's machinery actually going through our property to get to the farms on the other side. And I believe that a lot of the weeds are actually being transported by the machinery through our property. So, yeah, every year, there's a new weed which we've been trying to eradicate again, so it's an ongoing battle. But for the animals, I don't know, it's been a dogish year. I'll pop Claire on. She can...

Claire: Speak about it.

Marcus: Introduce yourself, Claire.

Claire: It is the lazy season. Yeah. So we do wildlife rescue here as well, as you know, Silvia, with all the wallabies. So we've released over 150 animals here over the last probably six years, and that ranges from everything from gliders, so sugar gliders, squirrel gliders, possums, things like striped possums, brushtail possums. Anything that occurs here naturally, we're happy to release individuals of those that have been through the rehabilitation process. Agile wallabies would be the most common species that we release here, so that's a macropod, very common up here in North Queensland, and we've also released a few swamp wallabies and pademelons. 

And just in the last couple of years, I've really noticed a decrease in our small mammals. So things like pademelons, bettongs, swamp wallabies, bandicoots, the numbers of those have just...we're just not seeing them like we used to see them all over the place. And I'm pretty sure it's linked to wild dog populations around here. 

So one of our big issues with land management when you have a wild area and a big patch of land like we do is managing feral pests. And one of the big issues around here are wild pigs. So there's a lot of farmers that get pig hunters in to shoot the pigs. And then they actually will just leave the carcasses where they've been shot. And I feel that that has actually given the wild dog populations around here a food source because I know last year they said they shot and killed around 150 wild pigs in the properties next to us, and that, of course, is just giving these wild dogs just so much food to breed and produce more. 

So we're looking into different strategies of controlling the wild dogs, but we don't wanna use things like baits, because the baits then catch other carnivorous native animals like quails and even birds like eagles and hawks will be killed by baited meat. So we're really not keen. We've tried using traps, but dogs are pretty smart, so I'm pretty sure they can just smell the trap a mile away and they just know not to go in it. Yeah, and we have been successful with shooting, but it's a slow process and you need to have a very, very good hunter, which we do have. But, yeah, it's a slow process and yeah, they have to sit up there for ages.

So it's something that I hope that we can get on top of again. It's only just been the last few years that I've really noticed that change in dynamic. But yeah. Hopefully, we can get on top of our ferals and bring it back into balance again. Yeah, it's just always a balancing act. Okay, I'll pop you back onto Marcus.

I don't know if I need to introduce myself. So my name is Claire Becker and I live here on Sheoak Ridge Nature Reserve with Marcus. I've been here for the last eight years. So Marcus has been here, this is his 17th year and this will be my ninth year on Sheoak Ridge living in paradise.

Marcus: Things we do here. Now, as you know, we do education programs on the property. So you were one of our small starting steps when you were here. So this property is now used for research projects and teaching. So I think we've got seven universities coming here this year to do field studies.

Silvia: Seven?

Marcus: Yeah. So we've actually have just started to...or are finishing the process actually. So we are building an electric theater and commercial kitchen and everything. So what else has changed on the property? I think not that much changes here because we try to keep it in a natural state.

Silvia: Yes.

Marcus. So the only changes that do appear are slight landmark changes with the fire regime basically what has changed because of them, which is the spread of vegetation. Otherwise, we try not to change anything, and I haven't noticed any really big changes except for the weeds, and as Claire said, the small mammal population. 

There's one funny thing which happens, though, which hasn't happened in the past. Over the last seven or so years since we've been an official wildlife reserve, we sometimes find snakes on the property, big pythons. And when they're too close to the house and they're trying to eat our wallabies which we're releasing, we catch the pythons and relocate them further into the forest, or a different area. 

However, the pythons we're finding nowadays are really, really gentle to handle. They don't strike out, they're almost like tamed snakes. And what's been happening I think is that neighboring properties and everyone up here has pythons on their properties, but then they don't want them there, so they relocate them and they don't wanna kill them, because everyone does value the snakes because they know they eat the rats and things like that around the house, so they've got a soft spot for them. So the best place to relocate a snake is to a wildlife reserve. Because we've fitted signs down our road, I think they're ending up in our back yard.

Claire: And we've got our neighbors

Marcus: And I know it's one of our neighbors, he told us [inaudible 00:10:42]. And we've been releasing them close to his house again. So I think there are several snakes who've gone back and forth a few times, and they're used to being carried around now because they just don't know aggression whatsoever. So this is like a 4-meter long snake, and you can pick it up like a kitten.

Claire: It's different front lawn area. That's Laura.

Silvia: Oh, hi.

Claire: And here is Manzinis [SP]. So that's our little area of wilderness. Yeah, it's beautiful at the moment. 

Silvia: Okay. We will let you go now. All right. Thank you so much, guys. Take care.

Marcus: Yeah.

Claire: Bye.

Silvia: Bye-bye
