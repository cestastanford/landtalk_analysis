Interviewer: This is my grandma, Gloria Kennedy. So, grandma, what place will you be talking about and how long have you lived here?

Gloria: I'm going to be talking about Sycamore Knolls around the Child's school area and I have lived here around 40 years.

Interviewer: Cool. And what do you remember when you first moved here?

Gloria: When I first moved here, I would say from Hillside to Child's School, it was mostly farmland and very, very few houses. And then in the, I remember the 1970s, they started subdividing the property and Sycamore Knolls became, and then also Child's School.

Interviewer: Yeah. Awesome. So, how has the landscape changed over time?

Gloria: When we first moved here, since it was farmland, there weren't any trees, just wild grass, and the only trees were along the creek area and mostly sycamores.

Interviewer: And so what is it like now?

Gloria: Now, people planted many, many trees. So, now there is a lot of trees and many of them are very overgrown, and a lot of them are happening to be cut down.

Interviewer: And so I noticed the creek behind your house, how has that changed?

Gloria: Oh, the creek used to be about a foot wide. You could jump across it to get to the other side. Now, because of erosion and so much more runoff going through, it's at least nine to 10 feet wide.

Interviewer: And what about... Have you noticed change in the species in the creek or anything like that?

Gloria: Yes. Back in the '70s, there was fish, crawdads, meadows. And today, because of the runoff from the fertilization, there really isn't anything in the water any longer, which is very sad.

Interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in the weather since you've been here?

Gloria: Yes. When we first moved here, there was a very big snowstorm, and the... Oh, I would have to say at least four feet of snow and drifting. And now today, a couple of inches. Otherwise...

Interviewer: Yeah. Wow.Â And lastly, what kind of hobbies or activities have you picked up here while you've been living in Bloomington?

Gloria: I love to walk, and gardening, and yard work. And I'll have to say I do a lot of yard work because my yard is at least three-quarters of an acre with the creek in there.

Interviewer: Oh, wow. Yeah.

Gloria: So, it's fun to work outside.

Interviewer: All right. Well, thanks, gram.

Gloria: You're welcome.

Interviewer: See you later.

Gloria: My pleasure.
