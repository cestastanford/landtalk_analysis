It all began here, in 1962. That's the year we moved here, in May. This was a three-bedroom home that we purchased. It had a driveway. It was just an old driveway we had then. It was made out of gravel, rocks. And, we changed that up the next year, with concrete down on the driveway. And that was '63. '64, we just made a cycle driveway around, where you could come in at one end and go out it the other way. Now, since we've been here, we made some modification to the home here.

This room here was a screened-in porch. And that bedroom was right behind the porch. So what we did, we knocked that inner wall out, what would divide the porch and the bedroom, and extended the bedroom and made a master bedroom on this side. Right here, that garage there, it was an old garage, but that garage, we replaced that with the one that you see in front of this car. And it's been here ever since.

Over here, by the front here, we'd taken...that was double windows that [inaudible 00:01:53] replaced those double windows with the big one. And we had scrubbers from the corner of this house, at the back, all the way around to the front porch. The types of scrubbers they call [inaudible 00:02:13]. And that was here for quite a few years.

And over here, on the other side of the porch, we had a tree, see over there. That's a Japanese palm tree. And in addition, we had two larger trees. But we had them cut down and the roof ground up and carried away. Then we had this porch here, because we didn't sit on the front. We had a patio that we always sat in the back. So, we replaced this here, put this porch here. And, the kids...this yard used to be full of nothing but kids playing all the time. There was our baby daughter, and her brother, loved to swing on [inaudible 00:03:24].

If playing on one of the trees and she fell and broke her arm. So, we just pick up her up, take her to the doctor, put it in a [inaudible 00:03:34], brought her on back and they went at it again. Right now, we sat on the front porch now, and watched the cars pass in front on the streets, and we enjoy that, much, a whole lot. And these two trees over here, this magnolia tree, and this tree here, I set both of them up, about four feet tall each one. Now, in this place here, when I would first set them was two magnolia trees. One was here and one was down that one extra tree there. But that magnolia tree died and we replaced it to the tree that you see now.

And a hurricane came through, and the wind was so strong till...this magnolia tree...the top of it was touching the streets out here. And that's when I discovered that it was rooted so deep and the roots were so strong, that I just...I didn't get rid of it, I left it there. Because, if that hurricane could blow it down, I didn't have no fear that it may fall on the house. So I left it there. And now, we sat on that front porch. We enjoy that, watching the cars pass. This neighborhood is...there are more of senior citizens here now than it used to be. When we first moved, it was nothing but kids, young people. But now, some younger people began to build and move back in. And so I guess we will be here for the rest of our life. I enjoy it here. My wife enjoys it here. And as a matter of fact, that's where our roots are, right here. I always wanted a place, I guess, where my sons and daughters, my grandkids can come, and see where their parents got their start. This is where they will get all their roots, right here. And they will always have a place that they can come, and call it their own landmark. All of them wasn't born here, but they all grew up here. The early stage of their lives is made right here in this spot here.
