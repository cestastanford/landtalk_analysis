Monique: Today, I'm here with my mom, Monique Fields. [SP] She has lived in Hyattsville, Maryland for 22 years. I'm going to interview her about her life in this area in the past and present. Can you start off by telling me what you miss most about living here 20 years ago?

Monique: Less traffic.

Interviewer: Can you elaborate?

Monique: Twenty years ago, this area was not as developed, urbanized. We didn't have as many communities that were, had...I'm trying to see the correct word or term to use. There are townhome communities, condo communities being built in this area now that are bringing more people in to this area. And with us only being about five minutes from the DC Line, a lot of people don't want to live in the city. So they're living right outside the city, and therefore, they're coming to the quaint areas like West Hyattsville and they have cars. And the more people, the more vehicles, the more traffic, congestion. And it just creates more road rage, more difficulty getting around with the number of vehicles that are on the roads. They are developing communities and housing, but the streets were not designed to hold this many people, therefore, creating a bigger problem that is not being addressed. So, I can definitely say traffic is the one thing that I miss from 20 years ago that was not as big as an issue as it is now.

Interviewer: All right. Can you tell me what kind of hobbies you've picked up from being here?

Monique: This area has beautiful trails. And I have had the pleasure of developing a love for cycling as well as running. And with easy access to, I think it's the Northwest Branch Trail, cycling to like Artemesia and Greenbelt, running the trail up towards Adelphi, has really been a wonderful thing. You get to see the deer, the beautiful foliage in the fall, the leaves coming back in the spring, rabbits, hamsters, chipmunks...well, not hamsters, but chipmunks, you know, things like that. And it's just nice to get out and be able to experience nature by cycling and running and those sort of things. That's really one of the great things about living in this area.

Interviewer: All right. What is your favorite part about living here?

Monique: Oh my gosh, the diversity.

Interviewer: Can you tell me more about the diversity?

Monique: You can go in any given direction around here and you will find a plethora of culture. We have Ethiopian, we have Hispanic. We have so many different ethnicities, the culture, the food, the music, the fashion, you know, I mean, it's just so much, it's so nice. It's like a melting pot here. We have Hyattsville, Langley Park, Takoma Park, Silver Spring. And it's just a wonderful place to expose yourself to. You know, you can just go out and walk or drive to, maybe a mile or two and you'll be able to find so many different restaurants, clothing stores, a lot of different places. And that's a really nice thing to be able to experience. Even if you have children who've never, you know, seen anything outside of their culture, you're able to expose them to different things and I really think that's a nice part about being out here. It's really a great thing. I love it here.

Interviewer: Has there been any big major like changes to the area?

Monique: Well, Ryan Homes has come in. Well, it seems that, not necessarily Ryan Homes, but they're one of the bigger corporations housing development companies. But they seem to have put their foot down in this area with building multiple community of townhomes. And then we have the very expensive condos. And with that, it seems that the cost of living has increased in this area. They've redone what is now The Mall at Prince Georges and brought in restaurants and clothing stores that were not the norm in this area. So, I do think that, and this may sound a little... I don't know the word I'm trying to say. But, I think with that being said, they're trying to bring... I'm trying to figure out what to say. They're trying to raise the property value in the community by utilizing land that's not been used that has actually been sitting empty and underused for years. So, I think with that being said, we'll see a lot more development. They're actually building...another company is building a community where a warehouse sat empty for as long as I can remember when we first moved out into this area, that warehouse was empty and now they're building a townhome community and a high-rise community. So I see there's a lot of development in the area.

Interviewer: Okay, I have one last question. Has there been any change in the nature around here? Like, as in like trees, plants, animals?

Monique: Well, there were more deer 20 years ago. I don't see as many as I used to. The birds, I've noticed that different type of birds have started to flock here, which is a good thing. Other than that, I haven't really seen that much as far as a change in nature.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you for letting me take a little bit of your time to do this interview.

Monique: You're very welcome.
