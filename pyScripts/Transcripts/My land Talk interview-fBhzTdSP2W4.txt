Aretha: Hi, my name is Aretha Newman, I've been in the area roughly about 22 years. 

Interviewer: What do you remember from when you first moved here?

Aretha: It was a complete culture shock. Everything was a lot bigger than what I was used to, back in England. But after a while, I quickly got used to it. 

Interviewer: What's your favorite part about living here?

Aretha: My favorite part about living here is the feeling of complete liberation. You feel much more liberated than what I had felt when I lived in the UK.

Interviewer: What kind of hobbies have you picked up here?

Aretha: Social media, community activism, and I think that's about it. [inaudible 00:00:53] two most important, powerful pieces.

Interviewer: What are the most common animals you've seen here?

Aretha: The most common animals I've seen here are cats and possums. 

Interviewer: Are there much of those animals there in England?

Aretha: Only cats. I've never seen a possum until I moved here.

Interviewer: What kind of trees/plants were or are here?

Aretha: Can you repeat the question, please?

Interviewer: What kind of trees or plants were or are here? What's the difference between plant life here than in England? 

Aretha: Well, England is an island, so it's much cooler. So, the plants tend to be much more greener, more lush. We don't have those super-hot summers like what we see here in America, and we've got plenty more precipitation. So, the greenery tends to look much more green. 

Interviewer: Verdant, okay. How has the weather been different from when you were in your home country to here?

Aretha: Well, in England, as I said before, it's an island. So, we had a lot more rain and other precipitation. Being here in Maryland, or specifically on the East Coast, we don't see as much rain, but a lot more heat. And I like heat. 

Interviewer: Have there been any big storms in the last 20 years?

Aretha: Any big storms? 

Interviewer: Yes.

Aretha: Oh, yes. Plenty. 

Interviewer: Can you elaborate?

Aretha: Sure. I would say about five years ago, there was just like a summer full of torrential rains. We lost power for like three days. And that was like throughout the whole summer it was every other week, there was loss of electricity because there were lots and lots of torrential rain. We've had a couple of hurricanes, I think last year and the year before last. And of course, quite a few snow storms. So, that was it. 

Interviewer: What do you miss most about living here...living back in England?

Aretha: The food, because our food tastes a lot more natural. 

Interviewer: What do you like most about living here now?

Aretha: Everything else, other than the food.

Interviewer: If there was one reason to go back to England, what would it be?

Aretha: Donald Trump. 

Interviewer: So, has the landscape here changed throughout your years of being in this area?

Aretha: Absolutely, because you've got a lot more infrastructure being built. So, obviously, the landscape is gonna be different with lots of apartments going up, homes being built, commercial land space being erected, things like that. 

Interviewer: What do you hope to see more of in the future of living here?

Aretha: Jobs. 

Interviewer: Do you have a specific field?

Aretha: Retail. 

Interviewer: What do you hope for your offspring to see in the future?
