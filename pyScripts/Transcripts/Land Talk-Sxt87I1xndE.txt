Interviewer: Can you please introduce yourself? 

John: Yes. My name is John Carroll. 

Interviewer: And what place will you be talking about today? 

John: I will be talking about San Jose, downtown San Jose. 

Interviewer: So how long have you known this place for?

John: downtown San Jose, I have known since 1982. So a very long time. More than 30 years. 

Interviewer: Okay, excellent. And so how did this place used to look?

John: I'm sorry. Pardon me? 

Interviewer: How did this place used to look? What did it used to look like?

John: downtown San Jose?

Interviewer: Yeah.

John: downtown San Jose, when I first was aware of downtown San Jose, downtown was a lot different than it is now. It was very much a dying intercity core. And over time it has improved significantly. 

Interviewer: Could you talk a little bit more about the changes that you've witnessed? So, is it becoming, you know, more high tech, or I guess like what is the different about downtown?

John: Well, midway through, you know, downtown San Jose just used to be a lot of homeless people, there still are. But that's all there was there. There was no residential units, or very few residential units. There was very few businesses downtown that we're not, you know, computer stores, and then book shops and things like that. But very old, downtown was very old, and they've been sprucing it up in many areas. So, that help you?

Interviewer: Yeah. And so you're saying the main difference today is there's a lot more residential units, there's a lot more businesses and stores?

John: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I think what it is is, in the mid '80s, 1980s, mid 1980s San Jose was, they didn't know how to best attract people back to the downtown core. People shopped in, you know, West Gate, they shopped at Valley Fair, they shopped, you know, the Eastridge or Oak Ridge Mall. They were shopping outside of the city core, not inside the city core. Nobody was coming downtown. So, and again, there was no residential downtown. So, that's one of the things. So, the city, first off in the mid '80s created a retail shopping center in the heart of downtown, and that failed miserably. No one came to the shop.
 
They had a movie theater, they had stores, and it was supposed to be, you know, bring everybody from the suburbs back downtown, but it didn't work. So in the '90s, they changed their strategy and they started building high-rise condos and high-rise rental units, you know, rental apartment units, to bring people living in the city downtown. And so, that is where it's changed significantly. There's a lot more people living downtown than there has ever been. And with that, you know, that brings people spending money in the evening, and that keeping, you know, the downtown core more vibrant for people, there are restaurants and whatnot. 

Interviewer: Okay, great. And so, now let's shift gears a little bit and ask you, what are some of the things that you used to do in downtown San Jose, back when you first knew this place.

John: Well, the only thing I did downtown San Jose, believe it or not, was work and eat lunch there.

Interviewer: Probably because there wasn't too much to do, it's sound like, back in the '80s and '90s.

John: Back in those days, downtown, you could go to Japan town for Japanese dinner. You could go to any place for lunch downtown, San Pedro Square, or in what was then Park Center Plaza. But really, very limited things you could do. The Center for the Performing Arts was open but it was struggling. But now, you know, now it has Broadway, San Jose, so they're bringing in Broadway shows, that kind of thing. 

So, you know, with the influx of people living downtown, it's brought in a more vibrant downtown culture. You know, with clubs, there are clubs, there are comedy clubs, there are theaters, there's the Center for the Performing Arts with the Montgomery theater, there's the Convention Center. All of these things came during my time here. All those venues kind of, well the Montgomery theater has been there since 1934, but it was kind of a dying old theater, and it kinda got resurrected. So, I don't know. A lot of positive things downtown, a lot of negative things too. But, I'll go on to the next question I guess. 

Interviewer: Yeah. The only thing I really have left to ask you is, what are some of the things you do here now versus, you know, what you used to do? So, instead of just eating lunch and working in downtown San Jose. It sounds like you...

John: Well, now, we will go see a show downtown, you know. Once every quarter we go, you know, we go to the Center for the Performing arts to see a show. We will actually go downtown to just eat dinner, just outside of work on a weekend kind of thing. What else is there? There's still not a lot of great shopping downtown. Mostly downtown has vibrant restaurant community. It's within walking distance to the San Jose arena, which is where the sharks are. You know, and the changes are expected to continue, you know. Within three blocks of downtown, they're going to build a new Google campus, which will have retail, residential, and it's supposed to be another shot in the arm just as downtown had a major shot in the arm when Adobe came in and brought their headquarters downtown San Jose. 

So, anyway. So, over time San Jose has much improved, I'll just let you know that. We still have homeless issue, but I think that plagues most cities anyway. We still tend to, I think, you know, politicians tend to still favor development and that kind of stuff with, you know, just for profit kind of. Anyway, is that it?

Interviewer: Yeah. Those are all the questions that I have for you. So, thank you so much for helping me out with this interview.

John: Yes, thank you. Take care. Bye.

Interviewer: You too, bye-bye.
