Interviewer: Hey, Chris, how is it going?

Chris: I'm okay, how are you doing?

Interviewer: I'm good. So could you tell me a little bit about Tar Creek?

Chris: Yeah. It's really a place to go hike. It's really good for like day hikes and yeah, going having a good time and that kind of stuff.

Interviewer: Is it very far from where you live or…?

Chris: No. It wasn't very far I guess. When I was back down south and there's only like half an hour or so maybe.

Interviewer: Okay. So we need...or I kind of wanna know the kind of things that you've seen change over the course of like the time you've been there. I know like you were little pretty young when you started going there. So you might not know everything like exactly. But can you think of any ways of like it's changed drastically?

Chris: Yeah, definitely it's changed a lot. I remember like the first few times that I went there was always like a ton of water in the creek and it was really difficult to like hike down the creek. Because part of the hike is like you're going on the trail, and then you hike down the river a lot just kind of like walking on the rocks. So I mean part of that could have been because I was young. But you know, it was difficult to just step across the rocks when I was little. But I know it's been a lot easier recently because there's just no water. Kind of a lot more trash has built up and there's more graffiti now. Which is kind of a bummer because that used to be a really beautiful and especially with all the water flowing and stuff. Now it's kind of overgrown with plants and graffiti everywhere, trash everywhere. People are not really cleaning up after themselves.

Interviewer: That's a bummer. So like back when there was water what kind of stuff would you do on the hikes?

Chris: So it's kind of nice the way that the river is just kind of formed. There's like little pools of water every once in a while. So like as you're hiking down the river, you can just stop and put your stuff down and jump in the water and go for a swim. Or even there's like a couple of places where there is like a natural water slide kind of thing. So there's algae on the rock and you just like slide down the rock with the algae on it and it's really fun. Sometimes the water would be a little bit cold. I guess now when there's not as much water it's not as cold. Like it's just sitting there, the sun's heating it up. But yeah, we used to just jump in swim try to find the highest rock to jump of off.

Interviewer: But your mom wasn't too happy about that?

Chris: Yeah, she would see a couple of pictures and videos and I would sometimes get in trouble.

Interviewer: So now there's not a lot of water what do you do?

Chris: Actually now so, Tar Creek, kind of feeds into the Sespe River. So most of the time when we're hiking down Tar Creek, now isn't really much of a destination to go to anymore just because there's not much water. So now when we're going, we hike all the way through to Sespe Creek, and we make more of like a weekend trip out of it instead of just a day trip.

Interviewer: Oh, cool.

Chris: So we do like overnight camping on Sespe Creek. 

Interviewer: Oh, nice.

Chris: Yeah.

Interviewer: Oh, cool. Is there's anything else you wanna add about your experiences there or…?

Chris: I just think it's a really cool place. I know there is like not many places in the world that you can see like California condors.

Interviewer: Oh, because it's a reserve isn't it?

Chris: Yeah. So I don't know if I mentioned that, but it's one of the only places you can see the California condor or like in the wild now.

Interviewer: That's pretty cool.

Chris: Yeah, we actually saw them a couple of times and they're like huge birds. Like their wingspans are over 10 feet long. They just likes soar off the ground and climbing off the mountain it's crazy.

Interviewer:  Have you seen one up in person like close up?

Chris: Yeah. And it was a few years ago so, I was still younger and I swear it was like bigger than I was. So...

Interviewer: That's awesome. All righty. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me I really appreciate it.

Chris: Yeah, no problem.
