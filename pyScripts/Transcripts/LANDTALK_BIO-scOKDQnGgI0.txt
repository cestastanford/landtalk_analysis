Interviewer: And how did the campus look? 

Interviewee: Oh yeah. A lot more just open parking lot. So, this whole monger, all this graduate and residents, it was not there. That was all parking lot. The engineering quad was really old. We used to have this giant building called the Tank, the Physics Tank. And it was just this round like red circular thing that's really ugly. There was a giant library with [inaudible 00:00:27] a lot of kind of older buildings. I don't recall as much construction in the 90s, as there's just like constant construction now. There's always something new going up and it goes up pretty quickly. It gets built and then they slap the facade on and, boom. There's just like fancy, new place. There are no buildings named after Ariaga or maybe the alumni center had just been built. So you know, you had to walk places and bike places. 

Interviewer: Did Lake [inaudible 00:00:59] have water in it back then?

Interviewee: Oh yeah, we had [00:01:02] classes where you could do recreational classes. Sailing... 

Interviewer: So it's not like what it is now?

Interviewee: No, no, it was like a full lake. It did dry but it always came back. I mean, there was activities there and I don't ever remember any kind of warnings around like, "Don't get in the water." Like we had last year, which was people saw the lake had filled up and they got excited for swimming and they got warnings like, you know, "It's not safe. There's bacteria or something." There's water classes in Lake [inaudible 00:01:40] back then.

My dad with a student in the 70s. So he loves when he comes to visit, he'll walk around or ride a bike around and just basically say everything's different. "All these mountain, my lab's gone, all these buildings are gone, or what are these new places here?" He loves to talk about how different it is and how much it's changed. Yeah. I've been meaning to ask him for more information. So when he was a grad student, he was international, and he always talked about the Chinese club house, and I could never like fully understand like what was that space? Was it like a space for international students? Was it a space for Chinese students to take [inaudible 00:02:26]? Like when you do a search in Stanford, it goes back a long, long time ago. But too far back. So I couldn't find like what that space was in the 70s. But he has such just really fond memories of coming together and finding friends and being very, very like dirt poor grad students, but really enjoying their life here and finding things to do.

Interviewer: Yeah. So I guess like for him, this place must be like so different because it's different for you. 

Interviewee: Yeah, I think for me...So coming back here to work, for me, it's about being a staff member here. So what I do now here and the way Stanford is, it's through Stanford now. And I try really hard not to be like, "Well, when I was a student here," so I only do that if people ask me questions. But the teachers recognize that it's changed, but this is how it is for you guys now and that's the environment that I work in. So they try and not to make things and be like how it used to be, but just share memories that people are interested. And it's space-wise. Yeah. I mean, just all these brand-new buildings. I mean, it feels a lot fancier. It feels more expensive. It feels, yeah, like there's just been an infusion of money and that in some ways, we care a lot about our image.

Interviewer: Yeah. So guess like, you know, like that Palm Drive drive. Has that like just stayed the same? 

Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. That pretty much has...yeah, has been there. I have very fond memories in being on the oval. Kind of like those classic Stanford moments I would say it's me just lying in the grass studying, or like roller-blading to the oval. I have great memories of like in the quad at night, and doing that thing that everybody does, of just sitting around the rosette and having some reflective activities.
