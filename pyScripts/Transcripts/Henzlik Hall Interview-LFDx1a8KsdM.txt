Interviewer: So, we are at Henzlik Hall, which used to be...

Interviewee 1: University High School.

Interviewer: University High School. All right. So, I guess, what all do you remember from like...

Interviewee 1: A lot. Where do you want to start?

Interviewer: We can start with the room we're in.

Interviewee 1: Okay. This used to be the high school gym, basketball court, bleachers on the north and south sides. Basketball, it used to be full court. And there used to be as a curtain that you could pull for a half court. And then there were basketball hoops at both ends, and then at both ends there. So, we had intramurals. I'm reminded there was a climbing rope that they used to try to force us up to climb, which I never got to the top of. We used to have a trampoline over here. So, it was multi-use. A lot of games, intramural games. What's the thing with the large ball, huskerball [SP]?

Interviewer: Nebraska ball [SP].

Interviewee 1: Nebraska ball, used to be a big thing. Ball like this inflated by air I guess.

Interviewee 2: Yeah. It was canvas.

Interviewee 1: Canvas, and they used to do an early kind of volleyball, with a net and trying to push it over. And so, they had that in here.

Interviewee 2: Talk about the banners on the walls.

Interviewee 1: Banners?

Interviewee 2: Didn't you have banners about championships and...?

Interviewee 1: Oh yeah. Yeah, I think there were banners. I can't remember that for sure. But I think there were banners and of course flags of the schools that we played. We were a Class B school. And in 1965, the year I graduated, we won the state championship basketball for Class B. 

Interviewer: Nice. Okay. What all do you think is like...what all has changed? Like, I mean, a lot has changed. Obviously, this is like...

Interviewee 1: Sure, the whole purpose of this room.

Interviewer: Room. The whole purpose of the building even...

Interviewee 1: The whole purpose of the building.

Interviewer: ...has changed.

Interviewee 1: The education wing was not built when I was here. So, everything from the end of this building on is new. We had classrooms, high school lockers were on the hallway. I can show you where different things, different rooms were, and what they were used for. Downstairs was the cafeteria. Right below where we are, was the cafeteria. And, of course, the auditorium is still being used as the auditorium, which is good. There were some major things.

Interviewer: How has, like, the environment itself changed? Like, because, I mean, what all has changed outside of the building?

Interviewee 1: I haven't really looked over there. But this used to be...north of here, used to be all of our intramural sports where we would play baseball. We didn't have football, but we'd play baseball, track and field. Our track, actually used the stadium for our track and field practice and conditioning. The stadium was much smaller then.

Interviewee 1: Talk about the courtyard in front, that you mentioned.

Interviewee 1: The courtyard is the same. Except, when we graduated, when our class graduated, we bought two concrete benches, for in front. And it had a plaque given to that class of '65. And, of course, those are gone. Further back, I was just telling your grandma, that there was a Methodist church across the street to the south. It was called the Emmanuel Methodist Church. And it's where my grandparents were married. And a lot of my family lived, like some of my family lived where Selleck Quadrangle is. Some of them lived on North 10th Street. So, there were all...this area was a whole, back in the 1920s, 1930s, were a whole bunch of small houses. You'd call them maybe four-room houses. One level, kind of in a box, divided into four, that had four rooms. There were a whole bunch of those houses in this area. And, of course, as the university bought the land, then they would tear down the houses. There were other stuff.

Interviewee 2: I was thinking of the bottom of the stairs?

Interviewee 1: The bottom of the stairs, yeah, was all cement. And now it's plants? Well, how would you describe that?

Interviewee 2: Yeah. It's been landscaped.

Interviewee 1: Landscaped.

Interviewee 2: You said there were tables out there.

Interviewee 1: There were tables.

Interviewee 2: So, on nice days, you guys could go outside?

Interviewee 1: We could take food from the cafeteria and eat outside. So, that was nice.

Interviewer: Nice. I can't think of how to word it. How did you feel as like the area changed from like neighborhood to the university? Like how it felt like, and how was it like to, like, be almost on campus while also being in high school?

Interviewee 1: Well, for one thing, I got to know the campus while I was in high school. So, going from University High to the university was no big deal. Because I'd already used Love Library. I'd already walked around the campus. I knew where all the buildings were. I knew kind of the size of classes, classrooms. So, the transition from high school to college was nothing. Just because I just changed buildings basically and classes. But yeah, so it wasn't much of a change for me, which was good for me. Because it was a terrible change for me from country school, with 20 kids to high school. That was a terrible...that was tough. But from high to school college, it wasn't bad.

Interviewer: Nice. So that'd be like the neighborhood has changed...like it changed to not a neighborhood. How was that like for...because you had family that lived, and people that you knew that lived in the area. How was that change...how did that change feel throughout the community?

Interviewee 1: I don't think the change was difficult. I guess it wasn't very difficult.

Interviewer: Sweet. Are there kind of stories you'd like to tell?

Interviewee 1: Yeah. Let's see. In 1963, I can tell you the room where I was when we got...that Kennedy was shot. That afternoon, I was supposed to do a speech contest at Northeast High School. And I had my car in the parking lot over there. And we were told that Kennedy had been shot in a speech contest, you know, speech room, down the hallway. And then, by the time I got in my car, turned on the radio, and I waited out here just off the street. Then I heard that Kennedy was dead. So, I had to go from there to Northeast High School that afternoon. And all the Catholic Schools, of course, had canceled. So, there were only public schools there. And so, it was a difficult afternoon because I was doing extemporaneous speaking. And my question, you draw up questions, and then you research and give a speech. And my question was, you know, what would the Kennedy administration attitude to the new government in West Germany be?

Interviewer: Nothing now.

Interviewer: Yeah. So, I switched, well, what the Johnson administration would be like? Three hours after you took the [inaudible 00:08:56]. Yeah. So, that I will always remember. Yeah, that was tough. Let's see. The Coliseum was a stride right across the street. That's where Robert Kennedy came in 1968. And this whole area was just packed with people. The Coliseum was packed inside, and there were people outside, college students, public. And nobody could hear anything because there were some microphones, public address system. But I don't think outside it worked at all. And it didn't work very well inside. So, nobody could hear him speak. But everybody was excited that he was in Lincoln. And that was one year where Nebraska had its primary early, democratic primary early. And so, everybody, all the presidential candidates came through Nebraska, to give speeches and do their thing before our primary, so that was neat.

Interviewer: Nice.

Interviewee 1: Let me see. The Coliseum was where we had all of our state basketball games. They were all at The Coliseum. I used to shoot rifle in the basement of The Coliseum. That's where the ROTC would shoot rifle. So, I would go down there with my dad and we shot a lot of rifle down there. They had a rifle range and a pistol range down there, down the basement. I don't even know if that's down there. I guess not. But they have a rifle team. Yeah, so they've got practice somewhere. You wanna walk down the hallway?

Interviewer: Yeah, let's walk down the hallway.

Interviewee 1: See, now all this is beautiful. And all of this, this whole building here... So the high school, the north wall was this wall. So, all of this had been built some 60, 50 years. So, we used to have all of these in between the doors where there's all...what do you call them?

Interviewee 2: Lockers?

Interviewee 1: Lockers, thank you. This used to be the main office, the principal's office.

[00:11:43]

[silence]

[00:12:04]

Interviewee 1: All of this. Then this, over here was the library, high school library. And then this was the speech room, where we were told that Kennedy had been shot, next to a classroom. And then you go downstairs. So, from the exit sign, basically, all that is new. That whole building is new. So, our high school ended there.

Interviewer: Well I see, you can still get into the basement that way though.

Interviewee 1: In here was a speech lab. Because we were connected with the university, we had a speech lab. Which was among the first in the state at least, where you had a teacher with a microphone, and she would due to the language lessons and she could listen in on different students. And so you check pronunciation and all that.

Interviewer: Nice.

Interviewee 1: So, the speech lab was one of the unique things about University High. You had to apply to University High but they kept...they took everybody that wanted to come in, basically. So, it wasn't...you just had to apply and pay a little bit of money. I can't remember how much it was, but it wasn't much tuition.

Interviewer: So, you got a comment?

Interviewee 3: I'm just looking at the artwork. The club artwork because [inaudible 00:13:44] and one used Nebraska Simpson [SP].

Interviewer: Nice. I didn't really notice. That's really cool.

Interviewee 1: Of course, that really wasn't there. I wanna see if the [inaudible 00:14:05] is open. This is where we had all of our plays etc. No.

Interviewer: This one is?

Interviewee 1: Oh my gosh. Wow, it's the same. They may have changed the seats but it's the same look. The stage is a little smaller, isn't it?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee 1: Yeah. The stage was lifted higher. This is where we had our student-teacher orientation. So, yeah.

Interviewer: That's cool.

Interviewee 2: That's where we met when we were adults.

Interviewee 1: Right on the center. Did you come in late? I came in late.

Interviewee 2: No, I came in late. The orientation was in a smaller room and a long table. It was not in there.

Interviewee 1: Oh, but we had something in there.

Interviewee 2: Yeah, we had classes in there.

Interviewee 1: Oh, class, okay.

Interviewer: So, you went to high school here. But then you also... Did you do like teaching stuff here or like...

Interviewee 1: No, in '67, they closed the high school and then all the student teachers, most students teachers went to East High to student-teach. And that's, except for your grandma, because John Lux, who was our supervising teacher said he needed a couple of volunteers for Northeast High School. And so, both of us volunteered. One, I volunteered because it was a little closer for me to come from West of Lincoln, to Northeast rather than to East. And then, grandma volunteered because her aunt lived up there right across the street from Northeast.

Interviewee 2: Aunt Jenny [SP] lived right across the street.

Interviewer: Oh nice.

Interviewee 1: From Northeast.

Interviewee 2: Yeah, so I would get to see her, have lunch, have a place to park my car. It was perfect.

Interviewee 1: So she volunteered. So we both volunteered from Northeast.

Interviewer: Cute. All right. Anything else?

Interviewee 1: No, I don't think so. Do you have any other questions?

Interviewer: Not that I can think of. It's kind of like a free for all.

Interviewee 1: I've never looked at this. Okay, Earl Sigrin [SP] was our principal.

Interviewee 2: I'm sorry.

Interviewer: That's okay.

Interviewee 1: And he's still alive. So, I'm at our 50th...55th reunion. He's still alive. He must be 95 years old. Norman Thorpe was still active when I was here. University High School 1955 to 1967.

Interviewer: That wasn't very long.

Interviewee 1: No, it wasn't. And before that, this was Teachers High School, did the same thing next to the administration building now from 1920 to 1954. And before that it was Temple High School, which is now Temple Theater on campus. Across was Sheldon from 1908 to 1920. So, the concept has been around, of course, still at East High, now. Oh, there, our state championship. Snuck [SP]. It was his first...

Interviewee 2: Yeah, Dale.

Interviewee 1: Dale Snuck. That's him also. He had two state championships for basketball, Class B.

Interviewee 2: If you look at the girls, the women sitting here...

Interviewee 1: Actually those comments are real.

Interviewee 2: No slacks. No pants, and I was standing outside [inaudible 00:18:14], 50 years ago, I wouldn't have been in this outfit. I would have had been in a dress, and so would you. We didn't wear... Well, you could have worn jeans if you weren't part of a sorority. I was so...

Interviewee 1: This guidance counselor Mrs. Mosher [SP]. That's a student. I can't think of his name, I graduated with him. These are our four exchange students the year I graduated in '65. Probably in one of these pictures [inaudible 00:18:53] look carefully. National Honor Society. I wouldn't be in that one. That's right, student council [inaudible 00:19:07]

Interviewee 2: We had student-teacher classes here in this building.

Interviewee 1: You see this was trophy case, which was over there.

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. I don't see it now.

Interviewee 1: Okay.

Interviewer: Sweet.

Interviewee 1: Future homemakers, interesting. So, it's a good concept. It cost the university some money, and that's what killed it. Budget cuts. So, you couldn't operate a separate high school, just for student teachers. Okay.

Interviewer: That's it.
