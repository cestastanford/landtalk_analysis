Mikaela: Hello. My name is Mikaela and I would like to interview you about the environment that you've experienced in your backyard in Palo Alto. It's for my Bio 30 class...

Interviewee: Okay. How nice.

Mikaela: ...where we're talking about the changes in the ecological environment of a certain area, and, in your case, it would be Palo Alto, your backyard.

Interviewee: Yes. So you had mentioned that you would like me to think back about my backyard over the last 20 years.

Mikaela: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you mind just talking about the changes that you've experienced over the 20 years, 20 plus years that you've lived here?

Interviewee: Yes, I will do my best to try to recall. Yeah. So I think, if I have to think about it, first off, the garden has expanded considerably. You know, we have converted some land, by which I mean that we converted it from being unused to being sort of a plant bed and then some of the other land, in turn, has been abandoned and returned to being fallow. A number of trees, of course, have grown in height. When we first moved here, you know, in the '90s, we decided to start planting some trees and, you know, since then it's been a while, they have clearly grown as you've seen around. Others have fallen out due to rot and insect damage, bushes have grown to sort of conceal the fence completely at this point. So, you know, I remember putting up the fence with my own hands and what you see now are the bushes that have sort of taken over the fence entirely over time.

Mikaela: Yeah. It's just grown out.

Interviewee: Yeah. We have learned to appreciate that. The underbrush sort of has gone out of control, I would say. New trees have grown into maturity. Also if I look around, I can show you the spots here where the soil has sunk in a few places. Often we find paddles there during the springtime. There are new plants, fruit trees as well, and flowering bushes.

Mikaela: Oh, that's amazing.

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. So, fruit trees, we have nearly always had lemon and peach, you know. I don't remember us growing anything else. I think at one point we did have an apple tree that didn't go very well, but lemon and peach have been here for a while. We've been growing persimmons as well. You know, we wait for the persimmons to ripen and, often, around winter we're enjoying them with our Christmas meal. So that as far as the flowering bushes go, we've got butterfly bush, wintersweet, and dogwood. The cool thing about the butterfly bush in a way is that it attracts hummingbirds. So we see a whole lot of hummingbirds in the afternoon.

Mikaela: Oh, yeah. I mean, we've seen a couple when we're over there.

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. So hummingbirds are just a real treat, you know. Whoever comes here, we've had guests and they're just attracted like magnets to the butterfly bush. It's their top choice. And then I...what else...let me think. We had a rose bush, I think, at some point that was attacked by black rot in 2004 or 2005. That was very sad, to sort of lose our rose bush to it. Yeah.

Mikaela: And the black rot only affected the rose bush?

Interviewee: Yeah. That was the one we lost.

Mikaela: Oh, I see.

Interviewee: So we really have to get rid of the rose bush entirely and since then we sort of had a couple more attempts at rose bushes, but we decided to remove them altogether and go with what we felt more naturally worked with our landscape.

Mikaela: And so, did you do that by yourself or was there a gardener involved? Like, what did you...?

Interviewee: So since then we have sort of decided to...also with us aging over the years, it became less exciting to spend our weekends working in the garden. So do we have a gardener now and, you know, the gardener handles nearly everything. So I don't know how much more specific I can get about the state of our garden. I can say...I can tell you that the soil has generally sunk or receded. In another spot at some point, I can't be precise about the year now, we had a tree that had to be cut down because of disease as well. So we had to call the arborist and get it completely chopped out. And the space beneath has received a lot of sun as a result because we got rid of the tree, and new plants have sprouted in that spot. We have tried to since then plant a couple of separate plants there, but decided to keep the natural growth that quickly took hold of that area. So after the tree was cut, you know, that spot was exposed to light and whatever grew then, actually, we've gone with that.

Mikaela: And has the area that you lived been affected by the fires and, like, the excessive sun and heat kind of?

Interviewee: You know, that's a question that I cannot specifically or precisely answer in a way that a Stanford class might want an answer from us. So I can't be too scientific about it. That's not my background. So I'm gonna be cautious in giving you a response to that, but I can say that, you know, we have a gardener come and apply fertilizer whenever something is wrong. Whenever something isn't growing well enough, he puts fertilizer and just fixes it. So while the weather conditions have been changing, and, yes, California has experienced a whole bunch of fires and smoke, this area particularly gets mostly the smoke from the fires, I don't think it personally affected our garden that much.

Yeah. I can also say that in another spot the topsoil was washed off during the rain and a sand patch was revealed at some point. And this has seen the introduction of a native ground covering vines. We decided not to stabilize the sand patch in any way as a result and the garden has always been fertilized, which we talked about, by the gardener. We've covered it with mulch yearly and added some soil to the beds ever so often. The cypresses that we have planted by the fence have grown so tall that, in their shade, what was a flower bed had to be changed to tolerate complete change. So that was another significant change where, you know, what grew in the shade of the cypresses once they grew so tall became...the whole area became so shaded that we needed to plant something that would only tolerate complete shade as a result.

Mikaela: And what would those plants be that would tolerate shade or were there not that many that you could find?

Interviewee: You know, I will have to check what exactly these ones are called that tolerate complete shade.

Mikaela: Yeah. It was probably the gardener who had recommended that.

Interviewee: Exactly.

Mikaela: Okay. I see, I see.

Interviewee: And I think not even the partial...I remember that not even the partial sun plants could grow there anymore, so that kind of was the change. The daffodils that we have planted have run away and naturalized below the redwood. Below our magnolia, the leaf cover has grown so thick that nothing could penetrate it anymore and... All right. So then I think we were talking about our magnolia. The magnolia is, yeah, the leaf cover grew so thick that nothing could penetrate it anymore for the magnolia, and the place that we actually had a trampoline for our kids took years to recover off till they left for college. So we sort of have that area in the backyard that was not...

Mikaela: That shaded patch? Yeah, yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah. And not just that, even the soil had sort of sunk and gone bad from the trampoline use in that area of the backyard. We had birds that were also nesting behind the shed, but then I think at some point, the snake got them and they have not yet...

Mikaela: What wildlife in the backyard in Palo Alto.

Interviewee: Yeah. Exactly, exactly. One year we had an awful moth infestation in one of the trees as well as I recall it. Yeah. But it went away by the end of the year.

Mikaela: You have a great memory.

Interviewee: Yeah. I mean, as you're asking, I'm trying hard as I can to recall, you know, 20 years.

Mikaela: Yeah. No. And it sounds great.

Interviewee: Yeah, 20 is a long time. Most people don't realize, but, I mean, a lot happens in 20 years. And to be honest, I've not actively been thinking about my garden. Yeah. What else has happened? We've been composting using fertilizer. We have installed sprinklers for the grass and the plants. We have even installed drip irrigation. I'm not sure if you're familiar with this drip irrigation system that gives the amount of water needed at the time needed, you know.

Mikaela: Oh, I didn't know about that, but that's very interesting.

Interviewee: Yes. We've had that and that has, you know, been great because when the plants would dry out, that was good. But the water bills have gone so high. Geez, it was sort of painful to see the water bills go so high because of the drip irrigation system. So, yeah.

Mikaela: Oh, God. I can imagine. Yeah. Because of the droughts that happened. Yeah. This weather is definitely not the best for plant survival.

Interviewee: Yeah. One year, we bought actually truck of soil. In fact, I remember too, the redbud tree has grown so much that we have to at some point also trim it because it was threatening the power cable. Yeah. So...

Mikaela: That's a lot of trimming.

Interviewee: Yeah. I remember how we were planting that too, it was a dwarf variety of the redbud tree and...

Mikaela: And do you mind talking a bit more about the insects in the garden as well?

Interviewee: Yes. Sure. Yeah, yeah. I will. I think on the acacia [SP] we had so many ants. Yeah. Once they get hold of it it's impossible to do anything around it anymore.

Mikaela: Yeah. Because we recently talked about ants and their traveling patterns in classes also.

Interviewee: Oh, how nice.

Mikaela: So that's actually very interesting. Yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah. How nice. You know, I remember my husband had bought praying mantises and ladybugs actually to put them in the garden and [crosstalk 00:11:37].

Mikaela: Oh, you bought them.

Interviewee: Yeah. We bought them. They actually arrived in the mail. Yeah. They arrived in the mail. It's so cute when they arrived.

Mikaela: Adorable.

Interviewee: They were controlling the bugs in the veggie garden, but as soon as I have released them, I've hardly seen them. 

Mikaela: You should have gotten a puppy.

Interviewee: Yeah. Exactly. Speaking of which I've still not told you how our dog waffles once...I've still not told you how our dog waffles once I went to sleep by the acacia, you should have seen her afterward. She was itchy for a month and really all bitten up, you know.

Mikaela: Yeah. Wow. So that many ants at one... Did that just happened one year or was that an infestation that happened over a couple of years?

Interviewee: You know, that... You mean, of the infestation of what actually?

Mikaela: Yeah. Of ants, right?

Interviewee: Of the ants.

Mikaela: Yeah. That's what you said. Yeah, yeah.

Interviewee: The ants that took the acacia. Yeah. I think that was not long. I mean, we've dealt with it I think fairly quickly, to be honest.

Mikaela: Oh, I see.

Interviewee: Yeah. You should...I'm just thinking of our dog, how she was all bitten up by the acacia and itchy for a month afterward, you know.

Mikaela: I'm so sorry.

Interviewee: Yeah. That's about all I can think of at the moment.

Mikaela: Yeah, yeah. That's absolutely fine. Thank you very much for taking the time to interview with me. Yeah. This will really help my class and it was very interesting to... 

Interviewee: Thank you. Yeah.

Mikaela: ...get to the Palo Alto area considering, yeah, I just moved here a couple of years ago.

Interviewee: Yeah. Great.

Mikaela: Thank you.

Interviewee: It has changed a lot over the years. I can guarantee that, you know, Stanford itself has changed a whole lot.

Mikaela: Yeah. No, no. Of course, thank you.

Interviewee: Yeah. All right. Bye.
