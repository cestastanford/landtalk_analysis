Interviewer: Okay, so for my land talk, I decided to talk to my dad, David Princiby[SP] Snr. He grew up in Johnston, Rhode Island for most of his life. He moved there when he was four. He lived on Belvedere Street and lived there for a majority of his childhood and is now back there as an adult living there again. So if you just want to talk a little bit about kind of what Johnston was like when you were growing up, and what it was like when you were young?

David: Well, Johnston was very rural when I first moved there. There was woods behind our house that stretched for miles. There was not a lot of commercialized, you know, built up roads or streets. It was very, you know, very rural and very...it was just not as populated as it is now. You know, growing up there we actually had a movie theater in Johnston at one point in time, that's gone now. You know, there's Johnston Memorial Park, which is actually still there, which was a place for all the teams to play baseball and football and basketball and things like that.

And all of that is still there but the town itself is going through a pretty big change. You know, I was there for probably 20 years of my childhood and then left for 20 years and now we're back there and, you know, my whole family's lived there my whole life. So it's not like we ever really...we didn't live there but we were always in Johnston for, you know, all that time frame. But the town itself has gone through a very large change.

Interviewer: Yeah. What type of like, has your neighborhood stayed relatively the same size or have like the areas around there really expanded?

David: The neighborhood where I grew up has probably quadrupled in size. Like I said before, there was nothing but woods from out my mom's back door all the way up to the Johnston High School which was probably, you know, as the crow flies through the woods, a good three or four-mile stretch. That entire area has been built up and it's more houses which means more people, which means more roads, and more cars on the road. Also over near the high school, they built more soccer fields and indoor complexes. And they've taken most of the forestry out of the area.

Our cross country trail used to go through the woods right behind the high school, which basically doesn't exist anymore now. Atwood Avenue, which is the main street that goes right through the center of Johnston has become so commercialized. Before there was just a couple of little strip plazas when I was growing up there. There might have been a Subway or a hot winging[SP] place or something like that in there and a couple of small stores to where now we have super Stop & Shop and, you know Walmart's and CVS and Brooks Pharmacy and all kinds of stuff that was not there when we were growing up there.

But a few of the things that were there when we were growing up, there was always a McDonald's, there was always a Burger King. Both of those are still in existence. Although the McDonalds is in a slightly different location, but it's right in the same general area. But we've got a BJ's Wholesale Club now, Burlington Coat Factory, all these things that, you know, take up a lot of space that were not there, Home Depot. So Johnston has become very commercialized like I said...

Interviewer: So you'd say like most of the small businesses that were around when you were a kid, mostly like the family-owned restaurants and stuff like that have kind of been taken over by like, commercialized like chain restaurants and stuff like that?

David: Well, we are very fortunate especially in Rhode Island, they have a lot of family-owned restaurants and things like that. So there's still a lot of that here but right next door there's two or three commercialized places so, you know, there's a Taco Bell, there's, you know, the Mexican place [inaudible 00:04:14]. Anyway, there's, you know, Mexican restaurant, but then there's also places like Luigi's and things like that, that are all family-owned businesses that have thrived very well.

So restaurants are kind of the one thing in our area that don't get hit, but Mom and Pop stores like all the small hardware stores are gone, the small family drug stores are gone, you know, that kind of stuff doesn't exist anymore. But that's fairly common everywhere. Couple of things that have...like, we still have the bowling alley, Town Hall Lanes has been there since I was a kid, that's still here.

Interviewer: Was that a pretty popular...like, I heard you mentioned the movie theater and like the bowling. I mean, even I remember when I was a kid, we'd still go to the bowling alley in Johnston. Like, were those like popular things that kids would do like in middles and high school and stuff like that around Johnston when you were in high school?

David: Yeah. When I was a kid, Town Hall Lanes was very popular and actually behind Town Hall Lanes, they used to have a BMX little racing circuit where as a kid you could bring your BMX down as long as you had a helmet, and elbow pads, and stuff like that. You can ride on the little circuit with all the [inaudible 00:05:331] and the berms, and all that kind of stuff. There was a driving ring from Johnston but that's gone too.

Interviewer: Oh, up on Hartford Ave.?

David: Yeah, there was one on Hartford Avenue, heading up Hartford Avenue towards Scituate and then there was one actually down on Hartford Avenue like towards where aunty Donna lives. There was another one over there. Both of those didn't make it. The land is going up for sale and is being used for other things now. BJ's, that used to be up on Hartford Avenue, became so popular that they basically built a superstore BJ's, up behind Home Depot. That's three times the size and they got rid of the one that was on Hartford Avenue but still all in Johnston. That area, Atwood Avenue, Hartford Avenue is very commercialized...

Interviewer: Yeah, especially with the car lots and stuff like that.

David: Yes.

Interviewer: Was that land pretty much just all wood? There's a strip on Hartford Ave. that's probably...what would you say? A half mile long of just...

David: Well, yeah, they call it the Hartford Auto mile. And basically for that entire mile, there's nothing but car dealerships whereas like you said before, they were either just, you know, storage units or little factories or small businesses and things like that, you know, they built these... In that same area, there's a system living now over there that wasn't there when I was growing up. They built... Hartford Avenue is very built up.

Interviewer: Yeah, do you notice any changes in like your...like has the high school gone under a lot of renovations and stuff or...?

David: The high school looks exactly as it did when I... They have not done a blessed thing to the high school.

Interviewer: It's funny how everything else changes but the high school.

David: Yeah, the high school was fairly new when I went to school there. I might have only been like maybe seven or eight years old or nine years old or something like that back in 1984. But, you know, here we are in 2018, the school looked exactly the same. They haven't put any additions on to it. But the middle school has been renovated several times, and they've added wings onto the middle school. The high school was pretty big for a high school back then.

So it's probably just at the point now where it's going to reach that breaking point where it needs to get either some updates or another floor added to it or something like...The traffic in Johnston has gotten quite different too. Where we lived on Hartford Avenue, used to be a one-lane road on each side. You know, actually it was a two-lane road, then they changed it to a one-lane road with the Island in the middle to try and slow traffic down. And they had to change it back to a two-lane road because the influx of people traveling from Connecticut through Johnston to get to Providence for work has increased greatly where the mornings now are just, you know, a big rush hour. Even route 295 that used to go through Johnston was always a very quiet road and now there's traffic backups like everywhere else because there's just so many people trying to get through that one area where it comes right through Johnston.

We've got the big Citizens Bank Plaza that's being built over on Greenville Avenue. That was all woods before, it used to be motorcycle trails and things like that. Now it's going to be...I forgot how many square feet, but there's five buildings going up with a big parking garage, and they're going to have the Citizens Bank, you know, headquarters there. Johnston has done a good job of increasing the tax revenue over the years because like you said, we went from a very rural town to what my grandfathers and grandmother called the sticks when we were younger, you know, to what I would consider now a pretty Metropolitan town for the area, you know.

Interviewer: I mean, even I remember two years ago, running through those dirt bike trails where the Citizens is now going up. But do you expect that...I would assume that's going to change the traffic on...what's that street that runs on Greenville?

David: Greenville Avenue.

Interviewer: Yeah. They're building on and off ramps, right?

David: Right. They're building on and off ramps that are going to come and dump the traffic off right onto Greenville Avenue. By law, they can't make them go in and out of the actual facility because it's against the law. US Highway has to drop off onto a road, it can't go into private property. So just at rush hour and things like that, I'm sure it's going to be much, much worse. But they've actually...Citizens Bank did a good job of trying to build some things for the community in there too. So they've built soccer fields and playgrounds and they're still gonna do some walking trails. So, you know, even though some stuff has gotten built up, I don't want to make it sound like the town is so built up that it's still not homey. There's still some nice features here.

Interviewer: Nice. I heard you mentioned the Johnston Memorial park is probably a good example of that. Is that pretty...like I know there's...from working there a few years ago, there's three baseball fields in the park and then one more up top. Has that all been pretty similar or have they kind of expanded that?

David: When I was growing up, they had the two baseball fields down on the, you know, on the main grounds and they had a little house there that they had the fireplaces in and things like that, that people used to rent out, and the playground and things like that. But the walking track was not there when I was a kid that goes around the pond. They built all that later when I grew up. I would say probably when I was in high school or a little before that, they built the softball field that's up one level right behind the middle school. But they've gone through and done a lot of renovations to the area. You know, they've upgraded the basketball courts, they've put fences around the fields whereas before when we were kids they just, you know, have a white line that was out in the outer field and that's where you hit to.

Interviewer: Did the pool house exist when you were a kid?

David: That's a good point. There was a pool and a pool house that we used to go there for summer camp and things like that and swimming in the pool and, you know, they have day camps and things like that, which they still do. But for whatever reason they filled in the pool, made it a parking lot and that's where they store all the equipment for the town.

Interviewer: That's where good ol' Johnston Rec department worked out of.

David: Yep.

Interviewer: Yeah.

David: The Parks and Rec.

Interviewer: Yep. All right, is there anything else you can think of that is kinda stood out as like, kind of drastically changing or surprisingly changing or anything like that?

David: Well, even the demograph of people that live here has changed. You know, before when the town wasn't as populated naturally, there was much less of different ethnic backgrounds and things like that. Now it's very diverse, which is nice. But even like Killingly Street and places like that, that all led into South Providence and things like that, you know, the town is kind of switched over from a very rural town to the outskirts that borderline Providence are almost little mirror images of the Providence and South Providence towns. And then on the other side, you've got Scituate and Smithfield, which border Johnston, which are more rural towns, that we still have some rural aspect and lots of a little bit more land out there by the reservoir and things like that. So it's a very different town whereas before it was really just a blanket statement type of town...

Interviewer: Everything is the same, overall.

David: It was...yeah everything was the same and it was not very populated, and not very, you know, not built up to a point where now you try to avoid Atwood Avenue at all costs, because the traffic is tough.

Interviewer: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, that was definitely touched on pretty much everything that I was hoping to talk about. Thank you very much for...

David: You're very welcome.

Interviewer: ...for taking a seat and taking some time to talk to me.

David: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.

Interviewer: Yeah. Thank you very much.
