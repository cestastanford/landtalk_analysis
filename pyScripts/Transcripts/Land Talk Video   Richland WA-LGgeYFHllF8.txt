Interviewer: When did you first move to the Tri-Cities? 

Interviewee: I moved in January of 1994 right after, I guess, Mom graduated. 

Interviewer: Okay. And what brought you to the Tri-Cities? 

Interviewee: I got a chance to work for Pacific Northwest National Lab in the fields of energy efficiency. So that's what brought me to Tri-Cities. 

Interviewer: And what were your first impressions? 

Interviewee: It was probably about half the size. It was a very small community, although it was three cities, and then the combined population was I'm guessing less than 100,000. It's a very small town. You could go, you know, anywhere to anywhere in less than 20 minutes. So that was my first impression.

Interviewer: And what were some of the landmarks in the area then?

Interviewee: Lots of tumbleweeds everywhere because we moved in January. So that's when these weeds start rolling on. And then in terms of landmarks, you know that it has the Hanford Reservation, although you can't go there. So that's the biggest attraction, or it's famous for the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Beyond that, you know, there's Columbia River that goes through all three towns. One of the biggest rivers that flows from Canada to Oregon and Washington Coast. So those are the big landmarks. 

Interviewer: And can you talk a little more about the Hanford Reservation and what it is and how that's impacted the history of the town?

Interviewee: Yeah. My understanding was that Kennewick and Pasco, the two of the Tri-Cities were there before, and Richland I don't think existed before. Hanford town existed but that's where they wanted to build this nuclear reservation to enrich plutonium. And then they moved all of the Hanford people and I think they formed this city of Richland, I guess in '30s and '40s, I don't know, or sometime around that. So, Hanford at its height had, you know, over 10 or 15 nuclear plants that were enriching plutonium for nuclear, you know, bombs or whatever, other defense-related stuff. 

So that's what Hanford is known for. And then since we moved in '94, I think when we moved, they pretty much stopped all the production. And they were just basically trying to mothball the existing reactors and that happened. And then there was a lot of waste that they stored in million-gallon tanks. And those tanks were leaking, so they were trying to move all that waste into other tanks, bigger tanks with, you know, better resistance to the corrosion. So that work ended but now they're still cleaning up whatever soil contamination occurred during the time when they were trying to generate or enrich plutonium. 

And then currently they're basically trying to take the solid waste that is there in the tanks and then tried to vitrify. So the vitrification plant has been under construction for over 10 years now and it's still not fully functional. They hope to get that thing fully functional in 5 years but it's 10 years passed and still no sign of when it will be up and running. So once it's running, they'll basically take all the solid waste, low-level solid waste and then convert that into blocks of glass for storage somewhere. So that's what Hanford is. 

Interviewer: Okay, and how has the land and surrounding landscape changed since you first moved to the Tri-Cities? 

Interviewee: So when we moved to the Tri-Cities, as I said, you know, there were lots of tumbleweeds and a lot of orchards surrounding all three cities. In fact, even within the city limits, there were a lot of orchards: cherries, apples, pears, plums, everything. And all of those orchards are pretty much gone within the city limits. They've either been converted into subdivisions for the most part and then a few of those orchards have been converted to vineyards. And even surrounding the Tri-Cities, most of the orchards have been removed and then in their place, they're planting grapes for wine. 

So I guess when we moved, there was some wine production, a few vineyards here and there but now there are probably you know, tens of vineyards inside the city and around the city and everywhere in that Columbia Valley and also Yakima Valley. So that's the big change. A lot of the orchards within the city had been converted to homes and the population of the three towns increased by more than 100% in the last 25 years since we moved. And then again, as I said, the orchards are gone, the vineyards are in. So that's the big change. 

Interviewee: And what are some of the landmarks in the Tri-Cities today? Are they still the same ones that you mentioned previously? Are there new landmarks?

Interviewee: I don't think there's any new landmark that has been... The Columbia River still exists, Hanford still exists although they're trying to wind that down. Beyond that, I don't think the landmarks have changed. 

Interviewer: Okay, and what are some of the things that you used to do in the Tri-Cities and how does that compare to things that you do now?

Interviewee: I don't think that has changed a lot. You know, although I don't do any water-related sports, that existed when we were there. People still go on the river on their boats, on their skis. I don't but a lot of others do and they continue to do today. There are a lot more trails that have come up in the last 25 years that didn't exist when we moved. So that's one thing that has changed. I don't think we're doing anything different that we were doing or not doing when we moved the first time. 

Interviewer: Is there anything else important about the Tri-Cities area that you want to share? 

Interviewee: No. As I said, it's been a small town, it's still a small town, although it has become a lot more commercial, a lot more places to eat. When we moved, there weren't many places that you could go. Now pretty much all of the chains are there. There's still one mall, the same mall that existed 25 years ago. That didn't change, although there are a lot of little strip malls everywhere. So beyond that, not much.
