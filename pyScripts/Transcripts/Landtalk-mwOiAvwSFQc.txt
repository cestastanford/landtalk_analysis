Interviewer: So I'm interviewing Les Zackley. Thank you, Les, for being with me. First off, may I just ask, where you're living now and how long have you lived there for? 

Interviewee: I'm living in Brain Beach, Long Beach Island, New Jersey. I've been living there for close to 30 years now.  

Interviewer: Okay, so when you moved there, can you describe to me  what it looks like, how many buildings were there, how many people, animals, anything like that?

Interviewee: Sure. It was fairly populated, clearly more populated now than it was before. There's a lot more buildings than there were before. Obviously there's been urban sprawl. And more tourism in the summer's clearly is increased over the last 30 years. So more buildings, more tourists, it's definitely more populated. 

Interviewer: Awesome. Thank you. How would you describe what it looks like? The beach, the roads, things like that. The sea level, ocean, anything?

Interviewee: Sure, I mean, the shoreline has changed immensely. I mean, one of the biggest changes occurred after a massive hurricane hit the Jersey shore and we were impacted severely. Hurricane Sandy basically wiped out most of the island. So there's been a tremendous amount of beach replenishment. And the beach replenishment was basically government run and our beaches are way wider than they used to be. Before that, for about 25 years before the hurricane hit, the beaches were pretty consistent. They fluctuated all season. In the spring after the winter the beaches were very narrow. After a bunch of northeasters would come in, every single winter, and then the summer swells from the southeast which kind of rebuilt the beach. But the one hurricane completely wiped out the beach and now, the beaches had been replenished. We have jetties that try to prevent the beach erosion beforehand. And they did a pretty decent job but they couldn't withstand mother nature and that was hurricane Sandy which completely destroyed the beach. And mankind basically had to rebuild it so that's the changes that  I've seen on the beaches.

Interviewer: Awesome. Thank you. So I know you like to fish. Have you noticed any difference in waters while you're out in the ocean fishing or any change in what you've been catching as fish wise or change of temperature of water or anything like that?

Interviewee: For sure, yeah. I mean the water temperature it's hard to say over a 30-year period. I can remember warm waters, cold waters etc. so I can't specifically tell you honestly that I noticed that the waters are clearly getting warmer. I get a sense that the waters are getting warmer, I definitely get a sense that I've been catching different fish than I used to. In other words, 25-30 years ago, I was catching certain species that were very endemic to our area. And now all of a sudden in the last 5-10 years, I'm definitely catching fish that were more tropical. So fish that would normally be caught in warmer water. So if I'm fishing off the shore and normally I'd be catching croaker and fluke and stuff like that. And now all of a sudden every once in a while, catch a  trigger fish which you would never see but in warmer water. Anyway, yes I've noticed species even offshore. Well, I'll get into more  what they call dolphin or tuna and stuff like that are closer to shore than I ever used to get before. So yes, I've noticed the difference. 

Interviewer: Okay. Cool. And then have you noticed the change in climate outside?  Has it been warmer, colder, does it vary from summer to summer? Overall, what do you think the biggest changes from 30 years ago to today? If there is a change.

Interviewee: Yeah. I think, overall, if I had to get a sense, it does feel like it's warmer. I feel like it was  colder winters back 30 years ago compared to now. It's hard to say because all of a sudden, every you know couple years ago we had one of the coldest spells and the most snow we've ever had. And that may be climate change as well. Clearly, I think the climate is changing. I'm not sure overall in which direction but I do feel like it feels like it's gotten warmer, that the winters are gotten a little bit shorter and the summers have gotten a little bit longer and it seems to be getting a little bit warmer. That's my impression.

Interviewer: Awesome. Thank you. So do you have any  final things to say about the change in LBI or anything that you've noticed that's been a huge change or something similar in the past 30 years? 

Interviewee: Sure. I think that a lot of the changes that I've noticed are expected with just population growth. So there's a lot more traffic. There's a lot more houses. Houses are more modern and there's a lot more businesses, etc. Tourism has probably increased and stuff. And [00:05:44] the climate, I get the sense that things maybe getting warmer and then every once in a while we'll go through serious cold spell where I'm actually wishing we had little climate change where we're getting a little bit warmer, and that's not fair to say. But I mean it's honestly it's hard to say in the 30-year span whether I've personally noticed in an earth that's a billion years old, whether there was a  massive change in the climate. But my sense is that things are getting a little bit warmer. That's my sense. 

Interviewer: Awesome.Thank you so much. I appreciate it. 

Interviewee: No problem. Anytime.

Interviewer: All right.
