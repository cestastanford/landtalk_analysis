Interviewer: Go

Calabrese: Hi, my name is T J Calabrese. I grew up in East Hampton, Long Island, New York. I moved here in 1976 when I was 12 years old. I am now 53 years old and still live in East Hampton. I'm here to discuss some of the big changes that I have seen over the past 30-some odd years of living here. You know, from a surfer perspective, when I first started learning to surf in 1978, there wasn't very many surfers on the east end of Long Island. We, you know, trying to surf year round was very, very difficult because of wet suit technology. But when we found the right equipment to surf, there, you actually begged people to surf with you so you didn't surf by yourself. Of course, things have changed, technology has changed. The overall population of the area has changed along with the Internet has changed the way we're able to predict waves and be able to travel from far away to get to the surf when it's good. So, even in middle of winter, in the middle of the week, the surf is crowded. You never have to worry about surfing alone because there's always tons and tons of people around surfing. Questions?

Interviewer: How has the look of the places in which you surfed changed from when you were a kid surfing to now? 

Calabrese: Well, we've had a, over the past 30-some odd years, we've had a huge erosion issue with the eastern end of Long Island. Back in the seventies the Army Corps of Engineers came out here and built groins or jetties, which are perpendicular extensions of rock sticking out into the ocean which we now know, you know, leads to erosion on either side of the jetties. You know, growing up, we've had many ocean front homes during storms have been taken into the ocean by the, by the sea. Even the Montauk Lighthouse, which was commissioned by George Washington when he was President has had to have been... Rock buttresses had to have been put around the point, in order to save it. There used to be... When the lighthouse was built, it t was built 200 feet from the water's edge. And today, even with help of the rock revetments surrounding it, it's within 50 feet of the ocean's edge. That's using one example, but up and down the coastline, whether you're in Montauk, Amagansett or East Hampton, you know, we're losing coastline, you know, inches to feet of coastline every single year. You know, the next big nor'easter that comes threatens ocean front houses that were built many many, you know, in the forties, fifties and sixties. So, that definitely, definitely has changed. 

Interviewer: So you talked about some of the things that you used to do here, which is surfing year round with, you know, crowds. What are some of the things that you do here now? 

Calabrese: I still surf. Today's April, 2nd 2017. I surfed twice today. You know, we consider April still the middle of winter. The water's really super cold, but yet there was dozens and dozens of people surfing today. So that's the point I'm making. Things have changed. You know, we took the dogs on a walk on the beach today and, you know, some parts of the beach and we walked on today, there was lots and lots of sand, and there were some parts of the beach that were less and less sand. 

Interviewer: How has the erosion issues that you're talking about affected the surfing community that you speak of? 

Calabrese: Well, the erosion can, can help or hinder. You know, the erosion can either push sand in a certain place where it creates a really, really good wave where there wasn't one before, or it can take sand away from a place where there was really, really good surf and now there's no surf there, you know, now there's no surf. So that's been something that, you know, it's an ebb and flow for, in history. 

Interviewer: I think that's it. Thank you.
