Alameen: Okay. Can you state your name and your relationship to me?

Princess: My name is Princess Martin and I am the mother to Alameen Murphy.

Alameen: Okay. So, can you describe a place where you lived for at least 20 years?

Princess: I have been residing in the Washington, DC area for about 25 years. I've lived in Oxon Hill, Maryland. That's where I live and it's about five minutes from Washington, DC area. 

Alameen: So, the place Oxon Hill, Maryland, how did it look before?

Princess: When I first came to this area and started moving into Oxon Hill area, it was a wooded area off of the coast, right off of the Anacostia River. It was a wooded area. There was also a bridge, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge was there. It had four lanes, two lanes on each side, that connected Maryland to Alexandria, Virginia, crossing over the Anacostia River. And if you're on the Virginia side, you can look and see the Maryland shore, the Oxon Hill area. 

Alameen: Okay. Now, how has this place changed over the past 20 years?

Princess: In the past 20 years, I've seen major reconstruction in the area to modernize. Number one was to modernize the bridge and to expand the bridge that connects Maryland to Virginia, which is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. It took about five, six years for them to build a 12-lane bridge. They built one side of the bridge, and then they built the other, and then they imploded the old bridge. So now, we have a new bridge, and that gives us more, you know, capacity. So, it was an infrastructure change. Number two, if you're on the Virginia side and you're looking across Alexandria, you're looking across and you're looking at Maryland before it was a wooded area right there below the bridge on the Maryland side. Today, when you look, you see a whole new mini-town. It's called Oxon Hill, Maryland as well. But it's modern. It also is a major economic location. It now has condos, townhouses, shopping area, and they just recently built a large MGM Casino there. And one of the biggest features that you see is going to be the Ferris wheel that sits right off the water.

Alameen: Okay. So, what are some things you used to do there in like, the first 10 years you were there within the harbor, and how has it changed too in the last maybe 10 years that you've been there? And like, what are the things that you do now?

Princess: Prior to the renovations and the building of the new National Harbor right there in Oxon Hill, there was nothing there. There was just a wooded area. So, for entertainment, mostly what we do is go to the parks. There are several community parks in the area. There's actually one behind the location where the harbor currently sits. There's a community park there. There are several school areas. We lived probably about five miles from where the harbor is today. So, a lot of the things that we did were, you know, free activities. Of course, there's movies and those types of things. Areas where you could go walking or cycling. But that was pretty much it. Stuff like school activities, football, or whatever those sports events were. 

Alameen: And what are some things you do there now within the harbor, as far as like with the new renovation of the condos and Ferris wheel? What are some of the things there that you're able to do?

Princess: National Harbor has really changed the face of the Washington, DC area, and mainly the Oxon Hill area. Now, we have much more entertainment available for us. We have the MGM Grand Hotel that sits right there on the water. It's bringing in a lot of visitors to the area, a lot of entertainment. We have the area there, the harbor itself, where we had the tidal basin there. And we have the boats that are right there, so that people can sail, you know, around the harbor, and also, at the Anacostia into the DC area, towards the Washington Monument. And we also have activities there almost every week. There's a lot of visitors coming from around the world that come to the area, so you have an influx of visitors there every weekend for some activity, including local visitors.

Alameen: And this is all things that's changed over time due to just the growth of the place that you're in. They've got different stuff, something like outlets and other stuff there at the National Harbor as well, correct?

Princess: Yes. So, across the street from the National Harbor, we have the National Harbor Outlets. They call it Tangier Outlets. It's there, which is also another way of drawing in visitors and shoppers and spectators to the area. So, when people come to visit the harbor, they're standing in the large Marriott Hotel or any of the numerous hotels down there. They're able to walk across the bridge, which is probably a five-mile walk right now. I mentioned that we used to walk on the trails back probably 10, 12 years ago. But now, you have access to walking across the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and a lot of people do that. We have a lot of runs that are sponsored for fundraisers, and that allows people to exercise and get out and explore. And so, walking about five miles back and forth. And because it's connecting the Virginia line, it allows a lot of people who are passing through the DC area to come and visit the outlets so they can shop. So, it's boosted our economy. 

Alameen: Well, thank you. That explains how the National Harbor, which basically took place from just what used to be a forest and changed into what's now one of the most eventful spots in the whole Washington, DC area, with jar[SP] of attracting lots of people, plenty of people who frequently visit there. And how it changed from just an ecosystem or just trees into a bunch of buildings and condos and living space, and entertainment such as Ferris wheels and other activities. So, thank you. 

Princess: You're welcome. Thank you.
