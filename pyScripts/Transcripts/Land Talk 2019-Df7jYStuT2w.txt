Interviewer: Hi, can you say your name?

Catherine: Yes, Catherine Rademacher.

Interviewer: All right. And how long have you lived here in Bloomington?

Catherine: I moved to Bloomington in 1987 when I was 20...no, when I was 18 years old.

Interviewer: You were 18. And what do you remember from when you first moved here?

Catherine: Well, it didn't have as much urban sprawl, and all the apartment complexes were not there. It just seemed like there was more green space. It just seemed like it was more like a hippie vibe if you would, and just, I don't know, it just seems simpler, like a hometown feel.

Interviewer: What was your favorite part about living here when you moved here?

Catherine: I think my favorite part of living here was it was just so much more creative and interesting, the art scene, and just the open-mindedness of the people. I know this doesn't have much to do with the environment. But it just was a lot more open and free compared to where I was living, you know, a more conservative place.

Interviewer: And what do you like most about living here now?

Catherine: Well, like I said, the art scene has really exploded. They have BEAT now, or BEAD, excuse me. And I would consider it more of an urban vibe instead of that, like, hometown, lazy vibe, which is good and bad. It's just kind of I guess it's keeping up sort of, but also just the different cultural experiences that people can get in our town, great restaurants, unique stores, eclectic feel. That's really what I like about it here.

Interviewer: All right. And you said it was a more of a hometown vibe. Do you think that it's changed more in the city or more because of the college, because it's a college town?

Catherine: I think just in the city, I think our government leaders are such that they're looking for progress. And it's almost turned into a mini indie kind of thing, which, again, I don't know if I really like, but I do think it's the government not necessarily college that's bringing that to head. Also, I didn't mention other things that make this area nice is the trails that they've put in town, and that's been really nice. We do a lot of biking on the trails, and I live close to the trail, so we can just get into town that way and it's a lot better. And also, say, things like Springmill and McCormick's Creek in Brown County are also big draws for me to go hiking and cycling, and being out in nature.

Interviewer: Cool. So in the more environmental side. What kind of animals have you seen here, and has it changed throughout the years?

Catherine: I would say the deer population has really grown. And now that I've lived in several different houses, watching them eat my entire backyard of plants, that's been an issue. That's really the only thing that I've seen change really since we do live in this city and not out in the country. But everything else has been about the same.

Interviewer: All right. And the same question about trees and plants.

Catherine: That I don't know. I don't think that I've paid that much attention to it, but it does seem that there has been more planting of trees. And so that's nice that communities are doing more of that. [inaudible 00:04:07] there.

Interviewer: And what do you miss most about living here 20 years ago?

Catherine: It's a lot busier, it's a lot faster-paced, I hate the parking meters downtown, just so many people they're trying to shove into these small spaces. That's really frustrating for me that, you know, we're getting these what we call high-rise buildings, you know, downtown and taking down places like Rhinos and putting up, you know, places for people to live, which I don't know if that's necessary. I mean, we should be spending more money on housing for lower-class income people, which they are, on Roger Street, but I just think that the fast-pacedness has really been the thing I hate about it.

Interviewer: And are there places that you used to be able to go, like more natural places that you used to be able to go that you can't go anymore because of the urbanization or, like, have been replaced?

Catherine: Not really. I mean, they've done some good work with Lake Lemon too that when they drained it and then put it back together. So that's one of my favorite places. You know, I mean, again, I think they've done a really good job of sustaining those kinds of parks. I'm trying to think about in the city, and putting in that trail has been really great. I'm really looking forward to see what they do with the B-line and all of that. I'll be honest, not really.

Interviewer: Not really?

Catherine: Yeah.

Interviewer: So would you say that they've been successful at, like, keeping green spaces in the city even with the urbanization?

Catherine: Yeah. In most places, yeah.

Interviewer: All right. Cool.

Catherine: I don't know if I'm contradicting myself, but...

Interviewer: No. That's fine. All right. Well, thank you so much.

Catherine: Sure. Thank you.

Interviewer: Thank you for your help.

Catherine: Yeah.
