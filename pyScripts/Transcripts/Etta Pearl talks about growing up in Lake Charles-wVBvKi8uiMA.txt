Etta: My name is Etta Pearl Mitchell Pete. I'm from Lake Charles, Louisiana. I am 74-years-old. I have lived here basically all my life. I lived in Battle Creek, Michigan for about eight months. But the majority of my life I've lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and I went to school in Baton Rouge which is about 160 miles from here. So I'm basically Louisianan.

Basically, I can say I've lived in Lake Charles about 71 years, take away four of them, okay. We have a lot of flowers, a lot of trees, a lot of grass. We have water, we're surrounded by pretty good water. We have the Calcasieu River, which kind of goes around the west side of the city and to the south a little bit. Kind of makes like a little L around, and it goes into the inner coastal canal which runs into the Gulf of Mexico. Now, we lost a lot of our trees when we had Hurricane Rita, but because there was an abundance of them, we still have a lot.

When I was a little girl, we used to be outside a lot, so we cooled off under the trees, they kept us cool. I had a grandmother who likes to garden so every spring we had a flower garden, We would even, you know, use trees to make some of our toys, like we call them a pop gun. We used to use the channel [SP] bear trees and we would make a pop gun and shoot the channel bears through that. So we used them to make our ties. Another thing that we did, most of the swings, well, all of the swings at that time were on trees. Our parents would take a rope, make a...you know, put it across the branches, and then it would take a piece of wood to make a seat. So our swings were in the trees.

Well, the one thing I noticed is that a lot of people cut down trees. They don't cherish the trees as they used to. Because of the plants, we are surrounded on the west side of our city by plants. Some of the trees die. A lot of the greenery killed the trees on the west side of our city. I can tell you one thing, we have more grass now than we had when I was a little girl. Because see, when I was a little girl we played outside a lot, which means that we played marbles and we played marbles on dirt. But now, kids don't play outside like we did. So most of the yards now are all grass. We had a little dirt and a little grass. As a matter of fact, my grandmother used to sweep the yard. So as she swept the yard, there was no grass. We had to keep it clean because they had a lot of livestock. They had chickens in the yard, so we had to keep the yard clean.

Like I said, before Hurricane Rita took most of our trees, I could tell you on our church property when we got back, we had about nine holes where trees were, but the trees were not in that yard. Which may blew somewhere down the streets. Something like that. So we lost a lot of trees. As a matter of fact, when we got back into our city after about a week, it was just like sunshine was so bright, something like we'd never seen it before, because the trees were gone. And because of the trees being gone, we had no birds and we had no squirrels.

Yes, the squirrels came back, had come back and the birds have come back. Well, right now I am the Executive Director for Southwest Louisiana sickle cell anemia, and I basically do a lot of work in the community, educating the community as well as those people with sickle cell disease on the disease. And as far as gardens are concerned we do it, we try to do a little earth garden in our backyard, but we got some little squirrels that don't like that, and so they eat up a lot of our stuff. One year we yield one tomato, they even ate up the green onions but we try to keep a little bit of an earth garden. Right now I have some rosemary and I have some, what's the rosemary and then a little chas I think.

Man: There's no more chas.

Etta: Okay, we don't have no more chas [inaudible 00:06:48]. We just Rosemary.

Man: Some basil.

Etta: Basil, that's what we got, a little basil. And then we get a little mit in the spring in our little earth garden. Right now I'm in a group at my church called Growing in Grace. So that's what we plant, we plant herbs. We go to our little sessions and our instructor gave us herb, you know, little cuttings of and so we bring them home and we put them in pots and that's what we grow.

Woman: Well, thanks granny. That's all I needed. I think that should be good.
