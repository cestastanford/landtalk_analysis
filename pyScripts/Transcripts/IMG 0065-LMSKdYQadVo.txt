Interviewer: Can you state your name for me, please?

Michael: Michael Singer.

Interviewer: Michael Singer, how old are you.

Michael: I'm 55 years old.

Interviewer: And how long have you lived in San Antonio, Texas?

Michael: Twenty-six years.

Interviewer: Twenty-six years. So, one of the first places that we'll be going to today as part of this interview is Huebner Oaks or what is currently called Huebner Oaks. And one of the things we're gonna do is we're gonna talk to Michael about how Huebner Oaks has changed from what it used to be, why he believes the developments have taken place, his opinion on the benefits as well as the disadvantages to development with respect to the ecology of San Antonio, as well the commercial activities in San Antonio and its economy, as well as his favorite parts that he used to remember from the place.

So, Michael, can you talk to me about what this place was like 20 years ago, Huebner Oaks? 

Michael: So, when we first moved to San Antonio from California, we were very intrigued by the concept of land because, in California, everything was tract housing, you didn't get a lot of land. And when we moved to Texas, we were under the impression that everything was wide-open spaces. And there were lots of places that you could live.

And the time when we moved, we didn't have a lot of disposable income. So, we decided to live in a newly-built apartment complex called Ventana. Ventana was just constructed in this area of town between the medical center and Shavano Park on Huebner Road. 

We liked the concept because it was newly constructed and we had a garage, which we hadn't had on our own houses in California. And we liked the fact that it was a gated community with a community pool. And our unit was really nice because we had a backdrop of nature. We had a greenbelt...well, it wasn't even a greenbelt, it was basically...it was where we looked out and all you could see was woods, woods, and land.

Interviewer: Do you remember any of the specific parts of the ecologies, environment, like what kind of trees there were? If you could describe what it looked like? How did it make you feel?

Michael: So, the ecology of that area was there were predominantly two major types of trees. They were live oak trees and they were cedar trees. What was interesting, it was funny because the complex was...were around...they had a pool area and they had brought in two palm trees, which are not indigenous to Texas, but I always enjoyed it because I liked the concept of palm trees, reminding me of California.

But when I would look out our windows, I would see predominantly live oak trees and occasional cedar trees. There were also mesquite trees but those were pretty rare.

Interviewer: Got you. And generally, if you're to describe the environment, you talked a little bit the greenbelt, you talked a little bit the apartment complex, if you were to scan what sorts of animals would you see like roaming around, were there animals, any other sorts of vegetation, shrubbery?

Michael: So, there were some deer that we're seeing. There were squirrels. There were a variety of birds, though I'm not very well-knowledged in the different types of birds there are. But there was definitely...you know, essentially, you went out the back of our apartment, we had a tiny little patio that was cemented and all you really had was nature. And it was what really attracted us to this apartment complex versus a number of other ones because you still felt that even though you were in an apartment moving from my house, you had a feeling like you had this wide-open space and expanse because all you saw was nature. 

Interviewer: Got you. And so, we're actually turning into Huebner Oaks right now to visit. And you can see it...

Michael: None of this was here. This was all grass. This was all woods. This was the original apartment complex. And they didn't have as many apartments as they did now. We loved the concept, it was our first apartment with gated access and a pushbutton so we could feel safe.

And as you can see, each of the apartments have little garages. And the little garages were something we can keep our car. So, we had one garage and two cars and we are resettling from California. I'm gonna drive you around the area to where our apartment was, even though it's behind closed gates. I'll show you the general area.

So, our apartment was actually inside the gates here. And it was probably the second or third apartment building there. And then, there was nothing but fields because, still, I think this is still Ventana. We can keep going in with you, it was this one and it was [inaudible 00:05:35]. It was over here and there was nothing to speak of, it was the pool that was very close and you can see the onyx, see the cars coming in. And we were one of the units that basically faced the greenbelt.

Over the last 20 years, they have built a lot of development including a large movie theatre complex area, a huge strip mall with lots of stores, and they even...they built another apartment complex behind ours, which there was...there was is greenbelt, which is right here. They just opened this up relatively recently called The Mark. And then they built another shopping center, a strip mall area called Huebner Oaks. And the little area right here is the closest thing you could see to the original greenbelt, which is obviously now just kept for show.

Interviewer: What else has changed? And what do you think of some of the artificial...well, not actually artificial but the landscaping done in order to perverse some of the aspects that were once here?

Michael: I mean, I appreciate that they still keep some of the original trees. You could see a live oak tree straight ahead of you. It is interesting that there was a point in time where outdoor strip malls became much more in vogue.

Initially, we liked the concept. But, as a result, we also ended up having a lot of traffic. We lost our beltway. So we moved actually as they started to do some of this construction. So now, it serves the convenience that we're able to get some...you know, errands done more efficiently. Having said that though, it lost a lot of its, you know, rustic nature that we came to Texas for as it feels like it's gotten more commercial like most of the United States.

Interviewer: And so, primarily, the things you used to do here were just...you just lived, right?

Michael: We just lived. I mean, we weren't big hikers. We didn't use this area for hiking but we wanted to feel that we were far away. So, our home would be a sanctuary. Everything here now was just basically woods. And you can see some of the trees that were kept but all this was woods. And the woods went all the way from our house to the freeway, which you could see as I keep driving.

Over here. So, you could see it's a lot of acres. A lot of acreage was basically all woods. And this development probably occurred 15 years ago, maybe, 10 to 15 years ago. I don't know.

Interviewer: Was it a rapid change? How long did it take? Did this slowly [inaudible 00:08:44] away the landscape? 

Michael: They did in phases. So, basically, the first phase that was done was this Huebner Oaks Shopping Center area. The next phase that was done was the movie theater, which I'll drive you to and the strip center there.  

Interviewer: So, other people all...you used to I hear about. This is a...

Michael: I mean, the thing is it's not mixed juice, it's very much all commercial shopping.

Interviewer: Now?

Michael: Now, and it's always...and before that, it was just residential, it wasn't somewhere and they built it in phases. So, this whole thing was one phase of construction. The Huebner Oaks stores, which we drove in, and then the movie theatre and a smaller strip center, which you can see up to the right, was a second phase construction. Now...

Interviewer: And how long ago did that take place?

Michael: That took place about eight or nine years ago, it was a different movie theatre chain. And then when they sold it, they had a fire. They rebuilt it. They also expanded it to put in a trampoline park. And then when the original movie theatre's chain was opened, subsequently, they built this second strip center on the right across the street. You can see the [inaudible 00:10:16].

And most of the stores have turned over. There have been some that have remained but they're even...in this side, in the side we went to, most of those stores for, you know, real conventional shopping, have pretty much stayed the same. 

I would say 80%, 80% to 85%, while here most of these stores have actually turned over and have gone under new management, with the exception of this place called Louis Shanks, which really was there before...that was actually there before we actually moved into the apartment. So, there was this big store, lots of forests, and then subsequently, there's been significant development over time.

Interviewer: Got you. And so, now use this place...well, how do you use Huebner's now?

Michael: Now it's to do some errands, essentially. What's interesting is what's not here is there's no major supermarket. So, there's no major...so, if you're gonna go out for dining or you're gonna run some errands or you're gonna pick up some food, it's great, but from day-to-day living in terms of getting essentials out of a market, there is no typical market, be it HEB, which is our local supermarket or our Walmart or our Target, it's all more specialized shopping areas and specialized restaurants. 

Interviewer: And if you were to think about...you know, San Antonio's recently undergone some sort of population boom over the past 20 years. At one point would you say the...you started really feeling the population started to grow and how did...did it have any effect on the decision to monetize this landscape and turn it into a place of shops? And generally, how do you feel about that?

Michael: So, essentially, San Antonio is a series of loops, with circles within circles and initially, Downtown started actually 300 years ago. And there was a part of town called Alamo Heights, which basically surrounded Downtown and they built a freeway around that called the Fortane [SP]. And over time, expansion keep...you know, kept going up from the center.
And this was one of those areas that started growing out from the center, it started growing...you know, really started to take off in the late '90s and they started to just build this whole area. If we keep driving down, you'll see this whole area that was essentially developed somewhere between 1995 and 2005. 

I mean, essentially, all these restaurants and stores...I'll keep driving you down so that you'll appreciate it. And everything is built around the freeway system. So, the freeway is there and they built a lot of the markets and the places to eat and shop. And commercial businesses were built along this area. And you can see auto dealerships. And you'll see in about a moment, you'll see where the supermarkets are but they're all in easy proximity to get on and off the freeway to make it easier for larger numbers of people to get there.

Interviewer: And was the freeway here before you're here or? 

Michael: The freeway was here. The 10 was here before we were there but it was significantly underdeveloped until the late '90s.

Interviewer: And you can see right over here and again, this is sort of a taste of what the forestry would have been, right?

Michael: Absolutely. And you can see...then they built more stores around...and when we first came here, there was nothing here. There was not...very quickly, you know, as soon as we go down...within there was...actually, I remember...I'll tell you an interesting story. The first night we moved to San Antonio, I will show you the restaurant we had dinner in. I remember it.

And so, we went down...if it's still around. So, the Taco Cabana and the HEB were here. And the first night we had dinner when we moved in, we had dinner and there was [inaudible 00:14:32] drive us here to...it's interesting, I haven't thought of it until your interview. I'll take you right to it so you can see what it was like, it was...because we came from California and Texas was known for barbecue, we found the first local place that was near our house.

And essentially, all it was in this shopping area was HEB. And then the first place we actually had dinner was right here called Bill Miller's Bar-B-Q, and it's a local chain that has been very successful by a man named Bayless Miller. And he has about 200 to 300 of these throughout about 2 to 3 state area contiguous with Texas. So, I'll drive you in. 

Interviewer: This is in Dallas and Houston?

Michael: They're in Dallas and Houston and that's...and he may actually have maybe one or two in Oklahoma. Don't quote me on this. And he may have one or two in Louisiana.  But basically, he actually...most of it is run...his deliveries are run by being driven...I know the man relatively well. But this was the first place we ever ate, with the understanding that we wanted to try barbecue and we...my wife and I and four children came to this Bill Miller's Bar-B-Q right here, and had our first meal when we moved in. And it was actually 1995, it was June...wow, I have to bring this out. It was probably June 30 of 1995, it was a Saturday.

Interviewer: And what did the land looked like around here?

Michael: It was like that little area that you said. I mean, this was...Bill Miller was here. There was nothing in front of it and it was all...I mean, it was all, like, trees. It was trees and there wasn't a plot, there wasn't a chase. Actually, this has been a couple of different restaurants over time.

Actually, I'm going the wrong way but to just illustrate the point. And we went through this drive through. We actually drove through to get food.

Interviewer: So, there's also a strip mall over here that could be kind of...and it can [inaudible 00:16:56] like...maybe classified as just like a chain belt or not officially it isn't contiguous with Huebner Oaks but it is its own section and similar concept. If you can, maybe we'll drive over there by that store. What used to be there? [inaudible 00:17:14] Stein Mart?

Michael: Stein Mart. So, again, San Antonio...a couple of interesting in our town. Most of the stores we have are chains. You know, it's very little independence, especially this part of town. So, it serves a very much just suburban clientele. And this, the Stein Mart area was not originally built when we were first there, none of this actually was, it was just the HEB. And this was basically open land with, you know, trees and brush that were all cleared. And you can see that there are ordinances that...

They keep the live oak trees. They don't keep cedar trees because the cedar trees cause a lot of allergies. So, when they cleared, the first thing that goes is cedar trees. And you should see they built a lot of this area over time. And again, you know, like most areas, they've changed ownership but the underlying consumer nature hasn't changed. And you can even see that some places are still for rent.

And I'll show you one other interesting piece about the ecology. There's a church right in front of us called University United Methodist Church, which was relatively small when we first came, it has undergone a substantial boom. And what they did was in order to...I'll show you how they increased the ecology, they took the area here. I'll drive you [crosstalk 00:18:56].

Interviewer: Right here? This corner?

Michael: This corner was the original church but I'm gonna show you how it expanded over the last 20-year period of time, sort of the last 10 years, a very popular church in our town, it's a Methodist Church and it built, because it was landlocked by the school that built this overpass and built the south campus as you can see across the street.

So, services and...schooling's over there, services were over there. The public school, the elementary school, has been there for probably 40, 50 years. And as a result, that's why they had to expand across the street. And again...

Interviewer: So now, we're definitely starting to get out of the area that we are initially investigating, but do you have any final thoughts on Huebner Oak's transformation? Do you miss anything? Is there anything you wished were changed about in regards to the ecology, the environment?

Michael: I think it's a double-edged sword. I mean, obviously, as more and more people move out, they move out to get away and get more space, more land or depth, you know, further away. The problem is that they need to survive. You know, there are some...you know, you need food. You need things like groceries. You need things like hardware. You need things, you know, to exist in a suburban area.

As the demand and the population increases based on supply and demand and market forces and capitalism, you will have...they will build things around it, an infrastructure to support it. Our town's a little funny is that...and as most towns, they actually wait for the people to come before they build it. So, it's not like if you make it, they will come. They wait for the tax base to come and then they build the infrastructure. 

So, that's kind of what happened here. They saw enough people starting to move and they built things around it. And they've continued the expansion even further north. And you can see right here, they're building more areas, it used to be...well, there's still a good amount of woods in our area but it...now, the building is much more north in a town called Boerne, which is about 20 to 30 miles away, which is what it was like here but, you know, 15 to 20 years ago.

Interviewer: Okay. Well, thank you so much for being a part of this land talk interview. And that's it. Thanks.
