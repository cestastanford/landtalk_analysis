Interviewer: Hi. Do you want to introduce yourself?

Judith: Yes, my name is Judith Munoz.

Interviewer: And what place are we going to be talking about today?

Judith: We're going to be talking about my home of El Centro, California.

Interviewer: How long have you been living in El Centro? 

Judith: I have been living in El Centro for the past 34 years. 

Interviewer: And how old are you now? 

Judith: I'm 41 years old. 

Interviewer: Can you talk about how El Centro used to look?

Judith: El Centro was more like a small town with, you know, around was more a lot of agriculture around. You know, there not a lot of signal lights, very small. We had a low population. 

Interviewer: All right. And can you describe in what ways has El Centro changed? 

Judith: Yeah, El Centro is getting bigger now. It's more like a city vibe. It has lot more signal lights, for more traffic. They added more stores. It's not as small as it used to be. More food chains and stores, less local restaurants or stores like before. 

Interviewer: And so what are some things that you used to do in El Centro before like all this change started happening? 

Judith: Before we used to be able to go to places walking, because things were closer, less crime because there was less people. You mostly knew a lot of people around, you know, town. They get to know you, they knew your parents. So this is a little bit more safer, you know. As a kid, you were able to go to the park on your own without your parents having to worry that it was unsafe. 

Interviewer: And so now what are things you do now as an adult and has been self-interests changed?

Judith: Well the good part is that you have more stores available to you. So you're able to, you know, go to more stores, more restaurants, more activities to do as an adult. However, the vibe of like feeling safe or the small town is not here anymore. When my kids were at the age I was, I did not allow them to go walking by themselves. We have to be more precautious because, you know, a lot more people moved around. Prisons were built around the city. And so you have more people coming down that you didn't know either working border patrols or correction officers. So it's not as safe as it used to be when you knew a lot more people. 

Interviewer: So what would you say El Centro means to you?

Judith: I really love El Centro compared to other big cities. This is a town where I grew up and my kids grew up and it was home to me. Still compared to other big cities, you know, I prefer to live here even though it's been getting bigger. But, you know, still not compared to other big cities like San Diego or Los Angeles and stuff like that.

Interviewer: Right, thank you.

Judith: Uh-huh.
