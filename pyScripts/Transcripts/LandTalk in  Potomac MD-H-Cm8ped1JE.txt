Interviewer: Right. So I'm gonna ask you the questions about like Potomac and then how it's changed over the years. You can answer for like the backyard or kind of like the area that you hang out in Potomac, like Great Falls Park. Just trying to get a sense of the area. Okay, cool. So can you tell me how the place, like how Potomac looked when you move to Potomac or like just describe what the outside was like?

Interviewee: It's pretty manicured two-acre lots, you know, everything is spaced evenly. I would say very green, lots of big trees, some wildlife, fox, squirrels, deer, you hear a lot of frogs when it rains. So it feels suburban but because we're back into the national park there, you know, feels like kind of country-like as well.   

Interviewer: And what's the weather like?

Interviewer: Well, it's four pretty distinct seasons. The winter is relatively mild with, you know, typically one or two big snowstorms that shut everything down. The spring is wet, very lush with a lot of flowering trees. The summer is very, very hot and humid, and the fall is nice and teds to be pretty extended into November, even early December.

Interviewee: Okay, cool. And then, how do you think Potomac has changed over the years since you've been there? And like you gave me an answer for Great Falls Park, or just like anywhere in, like close area that you spend time in?

Interviewee: Well, there are a lot of restrictions on the buildings, so the number of homes and the density has stayed the same for humans. There are a lot more deer. It seems that they're being displaced maybe from building going on like further up the river. But I would say, generally speaking, not a lot of change. I mean, for the most part things are, you know, with the exception of like some very dry summers where things get brown or some really, really snowy winters, things are pretty consistent with the exception of the deer population.

Interviewer: And then have you seen any changes like down at the canal or at Great Falls Park, like when you go hiking or walking and stuff there?

Interviewee: Just a lot of people use it and a lot more kayakers there. So it seems to be more water sports on the Potomac River. The canal has definitely gone through a period where it's dried up, and I'm not quite sure if that's something inherently with the way the canal works or just kind of the result of maybe lower water over the cause of many years. 
 
Interviewer: Oh, yeah, that makes sense. And then, so can you talk a little bit about like what you used to do in Potomac versus what you do now? And like if there have been any changes when you first moved, like what things you would do outdoors in area versus now? And if there weren't any changes just like what you do outside, like interact with the outdoors, I guess? 

Interviewee: We mostly walk, run, swim, hike, you know, those are the things that I do now probably have not changed too much. We didn't used to have a pool so I didn't used to swim, but now we have a pool so I swim. I don't horseback ride but I see people used to horseback ride more commonly through some trails in the neighborhood, and there's much less of that. I think there might just be one or two who's left where they actually hear horses in the property, whereas I would say in the past that was much more common.

Interviewer: Oh, thanks. Okay, cool. Cool. And then anything else do you wanna say about the area? You confess with no objections.   

Interviewee: I feel like it's very pretty, very green, very lush, pretty calm, pretty quiet.

Interviewer: Okay, that's good. Awesome. I will end the video for the interview.
