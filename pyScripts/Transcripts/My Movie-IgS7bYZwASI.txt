Interviewer: What is the name of...well, it asks, "What is the name of location?" But could you tell me a bit about the location that we'll be talking about, where we'll be discussing the ecological changes? Just, what is that space? Where is it, and how would you characterize it?

Interviewee: It's the land surrounding the house, the land that's beside my house and then the house next door on the right, if you're facing the house. And it's that land sort of swoops up between those two houses, and also behind my house. But I think the most interest-...the bestest part to talk about is the space between the two houses.

Interviewer: Okay, so we're gonna talk about the space between the two houses specifically?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Cool. And that part's also uphill, right?

Interviewee: It is a total uphill slope, yes. 

Interviewer: Okay, great. Cool. Next question. I'm gonna look up the latitude and longitude on my own, so we're basically looking at, like, 20 years ago, so 1997. How did this place look before? Obviously it's hard to like, just give a, to say that all quickly, but how would you characterize how this place looked before, or around 1997, or within that margin of, I don't know, a year or so, what did that place look like then?

Interviewee: Okay, it was green, and it's still green, but it had, like, a totally different ecosystem look to it. Like, it used to look like a forest, and now it looks more like a, not a tundra, exactly, but...

Interviewer: Wait, wait, wait. Don't...Wait, so the next question is gonna be, "How has it changed?" So without the...if it's possible without the comparison, could you just go into, like, just describing what it was before?

Interviewee: Okay. Trees and all this ivy. Okay, does that...it was, like, an ivy covered hill, apparently, because that's what's in the picture. 

Interviewer: Cool. So what you're saying is, "It was green. It looked sort of like a forest. There were lots of trees. It was ivy-covered." Anything else that comes to mind in characterizing what the place between the two houses looked like before?

Interviewee: Sunlight was blocked out. 

Interviewer: Okay. Okay. No, that's great. 

Interviewee: But also...so, okay, yeah, no, no. So that's back then. 

Interviewer: Okay. 

Interviewee:  And I'll just leave it at that, but I...okay. 

Interviewer: So next question is, how has it changed?

Interviewee: Okay. The ivy's completely gone. I have no idea what happened to it, because I certainly didn't pull it out, but there is no more ivy, and I actually do not remember that it was ever ivy-covered. There's no more trees, the trees are gone, and except for one that's grown up since then, and other ones that I planted. But the original, like, pine needle thingys are gone, and now the hill transitions between, when it's wet and rainy, stuff grows, and then you have to clear it because of fire season stuff, and then it just turns into a dirt hill, with just, like, you know, the little stubbiness of weeds. So it transitions between a green hill, once the rainy season starts, and so right about now, and then from the summer until fall, it's just a dirt hillside. Whereas before, it was just always ivy-covored all the time.

Interviewer: Wow. 

Interviewee: And now it keeps switching. You know, half the year it looks like one thing, and half the year it looks like something completely different. 

Interviewer: Okay. My instructions are to not react in any particular way, but I have reactions to share later. Okay, so for the way you would describe it now is the ivy's completely gone. You don't really know what happened to it, and it's even hard to remember that it's ivy-covered, but the trees are all gone. There's one that recently grew, and some others that you planted. The original pine needle trees are gone, and now, for about half the year it's just a dirt hill with stubs of weeds. Those are the big changes. Anything else?

Interviewee: No. That pretty much covers it. 

Interviewer: Okay. Next one. Oh, you know, I did misread it. Technically, it could be from more than 20 years ago, but whatever. We're using a...

Interviewee: Oh. 

Interviewer: It's okay, we're using a specific time jump. Okay. Third question is, what are some of the things you used to do here. Again, what are some of the things you used to do here, and so any activities, or, like, how you used the space, or, like, what you found yourself doing there. And then you can also answer this with stuff you did before 1997 also. 

Interviewee: Okay, that's, thank you. Thank you very much. 

Interviewer: Was that your question. 

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so...

Interviewer: Yeah. You can talk about, like, when you were a kid.

Interviewee: The area completely scared me. Back then it was worse, and I thought it was just a scary, dark, forested place, and I didn't approach it at all. Sandy would get stuck up in trees because there were really big, tall trees, but I don't know, it's like the whole are was like some forbidding enchanted forest. I didn't even...forbidden forest. But I just didn't go there, so I didn't do anything up there because it was too scary. Then, I guess, like, you know, that's like 40 years back. Then, closer to the time period, the hill was, like, usable, like, I don't know, it wasn't scary, but I was afraid of it because it was, like, I didn't think I could climb the hill, or walk the hill, so it scared me. But then, I'm gonna say within...so totally within 20 years, I...

Interviewer: So wait, so this is the 20 years ago. 

Interviewee: That was pre-20 years ago, when I couldn't go up there because I thought it was too scary and difficult to climb. 

Interviewer: Okay. So it sounds like...

[crosstalk]

Interviewer: It sounds like you didn't really use it. But Sandy used it. 

Interviewee: It was not...exactly. 

Interviewer: Okay. So now, question four is, "What are some of the things you do here now?" 

Interviewee: So now, tons of stuff.

Interviewer: In the 20 years since. 

Interviewee: I totally go up and down it. It is not scary, I don't know what I was afraid of. I stand on it. Tom and Pepper and I go on a walk, so we're just up and down all the time. I'm the one pulling the weeds and cutting stuff back. I planted the two, the trees, because the area was so barren and there was, like, space, so I planted, they were like little Christmas tree kinda things that you get at the holidays.

Interviewer: That's awesome.

Interviewee: And now they're much bigger. I planted other things that have color, like Italian sage and oleander. Some of the stuff takes, some of it doesn't. Standing around with them, walking up and down it to either walk to the back hill, walk behind the neighbor's house with them, walk...yeah, it's like a, what's the word, like, yeah, like a pathway for, an avenue towards other adventures that we may go on. But, yeah, but it's so...and I try to keep it cultivated specifically to their needs, so I don't like to trim the weeds too soon in case they enjoy the tall weeds. Deers go up and down it, raccoons, it gets a lot of animal traffic. 

Interviewer: So thank you for just answering the questions about what you now do here. 

Interviewee: Oh, I also, did you, like, I'm planting things and pulling weeds, and...

Interviewer: Yes, I have that, yeah. 

Interviewee: Standing on the space. Which, I have actually considered that it's so interesting that the area used to scare me, and I was afraid of it, and now I'm up and down it like it's nothing. 

Interviewer: Interesting. 

Interviewee: Yeah. 

Interviewer: Okay. Okay, so, name of location, the space between your house and the neighbors. I'll look up latitude and longitude. How it looked before, it was green, very foresty with lots of ivy-covered trees and greenery all over the hill, and it was darker. 

Interviewee: Mm-hmm. Well, ivy, not, the trees weren't ivy-covered. The ground was ivy-covered. 

Interviewer: Okay, okay, let me add that. Ground was ivy-covered. It's nice that they had us, like, track our answers by you, I like that idea. 

Interviewee: Let me know when to send you pictures. 

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. Okay, so now the ivy is completely gone. 

Interviewee: Yeah. 

Interviewer: The trees are gone. There's one that recently grew, and there are several that you've planted, but the original pine needle trees are gone, and now it's often just a dirt hill with stubs of weeds. 

Interviewee: Right. Yeah. And I will tell you that as a contextual element, there's a tree that was in the planter box back then that is still there, and that's the same tree that you'll see on the right side of the picture. So there's the same tree still exists. That's, like, part of our house. It's not the hillside. I'm just letting you know as, like, a reference point. This is what I'm looking for, reference. 

Interviewer: Okay, cool. 

Interviewee: Okay. 

Interviewer: Three, what you used to do there. Not much, because you didn't really approach it, there's something scary about it, and you didn't really use it at all or even walk it, and the only main interaction with it was Sandy getting stuck in tall trees. 

Interviewee: Right. The only thing was it was used by, I guess, Sandy and the neighbors apparently had cats, too, and so, apparently I don't know what was going on, but, right, be very clear that the place...I thought it was some intimidating thing that I couldn't, you know, get on. 

Interviewer: Very interesting. 

Interviewee: And I don't mean, obviously I've been here for so long and I don't remember. It's like, I am sure I was up on the hill as long as you've been around, but I don't know at what point it transitioned, and what point I thought, "Right, it's fine."

Interviewer: That's interesting. 

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. So I'm sorry I can't be a little bit more...but you know what? The back back hill, same way. I was like, "I can't do that one."

Interviewer: The what hill?

Interviewee: The back hill. The one that's [inaudible 00:11:53] the house. 

Interviewer: Yeah. 

Interviewee: Absolutely I can't do it. I can't even try. It's too scary. And then this was a bunch of years ago. Avi, I don't remember how old he was, but he just, like, started up it, and I was like, "Oh my God. Like, how does he do that?" I...whatever problem I had with the side hill absolutely still applies to the back hill. It's some un-passable thing that I cannot do. 

Interviewer: Interesting. 

Interviewee: But it's also way steeper, and maybe this hill between the houses used to be steeper, and the terrain itself changed, and that's why I can use it. 

Interviewer: Right. 

Interviewee: But the one behind us is just...what?

Interviewer: No, I'm agreeing.

Interviewee: The one behind us is just so steep, and the slope is so severe that I just feel like there's no way that my feet can stay planted, and I would just slip right down it. So, yeah. Right. And so this hill, when it's raining it's muddy and sloppy, and the deers make prints that go deep down into it, and then when it's not rainy season, it's dry and the hillside's like, the dirt's cracked. There's big crack lines on it, so the hill itself takes on a totally different, like, constitution, if you will, based on if it's raining or dry. But obviously that's everywhere, I guess. 

Interviewer: Right. Last one to ask is, now you do a bunch of stuff there. You go up and down it. Tom and Pepper will join you on walks there. 

Interviewee: No, I join them. 

Interviewer: You join them. I do think I actually wrote down that you join them. You pull the weeds and plant the trees, but don't pull too soon because sometimes Tom and Pepper like them, and you'll walk around to the back hill, and now it basically functions as a pathway for, "An avenue toward other adventures that we may go on."

Interviewee: Awesome. 

Interviewer: Cool. 

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. 

Interviewer: Here, I'm gonna end the recording. 

Interviewee: Okay.
