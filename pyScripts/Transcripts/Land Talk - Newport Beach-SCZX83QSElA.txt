Interviewer: What's your name?

Katherine: Katherine O'Hara.

Interviewer: What place are we talking about?

Katherine: Newport Beach, California.

Interviewer: Okay. How did this place look before?

Katherine: As opposed to now?

Interviewer: Yes.

Katherine: Less crowded, fewer roads, much fewer roads. The roads weren't as wide, the ones that existed.

Interviewer: How has it changed?

Katherine: It's a lot more crowded with roads, more traffic, and a lot more housing. And in a good way, it changed that we preserved a lot of the coastal area as a state park. Whereas before, it was open land that wasn't accessible to the public.

Interviewer: Okay. What are some things you used to do in Newport?

Katherine: Well, when I was younger, I used to run and jog. And now, I walk those same paths.

Interviewer: The same ones? They're still there?

Katherine: Yes. Some of the ones that were there are still there, and some new ones exist.
