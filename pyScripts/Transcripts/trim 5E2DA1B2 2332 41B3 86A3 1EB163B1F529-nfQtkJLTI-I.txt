Child: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. How has Las Lomitas changed?

Woman: Las Lomitas has changed a lot. We only had 19 teachers when I first started teaching, and now we have over 37 teachers in the classroom. That doesn't count all the paras and all the specialists. Las Lomitas didn't have this library behind us. It didn't have a computer lab that was as fancy as this one. Mrs. Nettles' room, Mrs. Peterson's room, and Mrs. Gordon's old classroom were never there before.

Child: What did the Caltrain used to be like?

Woman: There weren't as many trains going back and forth from here to San Francisco. The trains were older. They weren't as fancy. They didn't go as fast.

Child: Thank you for sharing with us.

Woman: Thank you, you guys. All right, go into Mrs. James' room...
