Adrian: My name is Adrian Jones. Okay. 

Interviewer: Okay. What place are we talking about today? 

Adrian: Santa Barbara, California. 

Interviewer: Okay. And how long have you lived in Santa Barbara?

Adrian: For 30 years. 

Interviewer: A long time. Okay. So the first question is, can you describe how the place used to look? 

Adrian: Yeah, it used to be, we have a lot of oak trees and a low scrub brush and now we have a lot of dead trees. So those were prolific and green and now, so like they know what they are now.
 
Interviewer: Can you talk more about how like you land, how the land has changed?  So is there like more buildings is there less building?

Adrian:  Oh yeah, there actually has been more development. I was thinking more of just nature. But yeah, it seems like, I mean we don't have any tall buildings in Santa Barbara really. Like our tallest building is about five floors, five stories high. And that's pretty typical. And although there is a little bit more sprawl, we have about 10 miles from us, we have Costco and sort of an area like that that's actually grown a little bit bigger. We don't have a lot of shopping. In fact, we don't even have a Target in Santa Barbara. So for something like that, we'd actually drive to Ventura, which is about 25 minutes away. It seems like a lot of, they've been really trying to maintain what the town looks like. I think it's, you know, we have a lot of historical sites in Santa Barbara like the Presidio and...   

Interviewer: So the architecture, they're trying to preserve? Is it the architecture?

Adrian: Probably the style of architecture. So when they build new buildings, for example, they built a hotel down by the wharf and it's a kind of, has a little bit of a Mediterranean flare, maybe. It's a white building. So it's either Mediterranean or Hispanic or Spanish kind of style with white, with a lot of red tile. And you see that a lot in Santa Barbara, not so much of the homes, but more of downtown architecture.

Interviewer: Yes. Okay. How do you think the marsh land has changed near UC Santa Barbara?

Adrian: Well, there used to actually be a marsh land that they put a golf course in. And so they actually covered that up, but then you UCSP just got a big grant maybe five years ago and they've not reconstituted, but they've recreated that. So actually that area is bigger now than it used to be. So and then there's the marsh land...

Interviewer: The golf course or the marsh land?

Adrian: What's that?

Interviewer: The golf course is bigger or the wetland?

Adrian: The marsh land, the golf course is gone now. So I guess that land is bought. So it's now a marshland, but there's also kind of a marshland area estuary by actually all the beaches by UCFB and the airport, there seems to be a pretty big like estuary and like, you know, marshland and also, well, I mean the carpentry, which is about 10 miles from here, there's also a very big marshland and you notice it more, you know, when we've had more rain. 

Interviewer: Okay. So we kind of touched on this, but can you describe how this place has changed?

 Adrian: Like with nature? 

Interviewer: You can do like all encompassing, so like nature...

Adrian:  And buildings and stuff.

Interviwer: ...kind of population growth. 

Adrian: Well I don't know if the're been a big...

Interviewer: ...pollution, littering.

Adrian: .Okay. Well, I don't... I'm really not aware. It feels like Santa Barbara is pretty much the same as it was in terms of population, which is about, I think about 100,000 people. I mean, I wasn't doing a census really, but you know, I think there's a number signs that said about, you know, 89,000 or 100,000 people. So I don't think it's grown that much. I think that right now they're trying to do more multiuse buildings. So where there's residential and office space and it seems like that's happening more and maybe more low-income housing. So, you know, like duplexes, there's been some community stuff they've built in the last probably 10 to 15 years, which are duplexes for low-income housing because it's so expensive to live here.

Interviewer: What about pollution and littering? Have you seen an increase in it at the beaches or...

Adrian: I definitely... Yeah. Definitely I see that because I walk on the beach often and we'll often see, you know, the tide has gone up and then gone down, you see lots of trash and you see lobster traps and you see buoys and you see plastic bags and plastic bottles and jog balls. And it just depends. And then well I don't know if this is, I mean, what I've noticed, and this might be just the way it goes, is that in the winter, you know, we lose a lot of sand from our beaches. And so the beaches are pretty rocky. And then in the summer it seems like the sand kind of comes back somehow.

Interviewer: So the tide?

Adrian: So I'm not sure. I mean, that's maybe just a cyclical thing that just naturally happens. 

Interviewer: Okay. So here's another question. What are some things you used to do in Santa Barbara? 

Adrian: Well, I was thinking about, when youguys were little, we would go up to the river all the time and play in the river. And I mean, that was a typical thing that we would do pretty much in the spring into the summer. Several, I don't know, several times a month we would go do that. And there was a lot of water. And now that we've been in a pretty severe drought for probably about seven years and it's kind of, it's not unusual to see creek beds that are dry. And so we got some rain recently and there's a little bit of water flowing in the creek, which is great. And we have now, right now we have some, you know, there's some green coming back on, you know, just low-lying grass is coming back. But before that, all these deciduous, not deciduous, but native plants which don't usually die were not looking good. And it feels like we've lost a lot of plants. When I hike in the mountains and there are a lot of fire scars. And so we've experienced a lot of fire scars. And one thing about the fires is that it burns a lot of the low-lying bush away. So more of the sandstone is exposed, which is pretty, and it's fun to hike on, but you can see where there have been numerous fires. 

Interviewer: Okay. So did I already ask you about what are the things you do now? 

Adrian: No, I still do the same things. So like we would go, the thing that is probably different. So we would go to the river a lot and then we would actually, it seemed like once every year, once every two years or so, we'd actually get snow in our mountains. And so I would take you guys up to go sledding in our mountains and...

Interviewer: Awesome. So but we don't do that anymore. 

Adrian: Well, that has not happened for a long time. I haven't seen any snow in our mountains for a long time. And... 

Interviewer: What about, does the beach still look the same and like do you still do walks on beach and beach volleyball? 

Adrian: Yeah, so the beach... I mean, I noticed more trash on the beach. That's what I feel. And then I noticed that there's some, like when the bluff, there seems to be some more land slide. So some of the beach area has been diminished.

Interviewer: There's some degradation of the land.

Adrian: Of some of the beach. Yeah. 

Interviewer: Okay. And so my last question is what does Santa Barbara mean to you? 

Adrian: Besides being home? 

Interviewer: Well, that can be what it means to you, but like home, family and...

Adrian: Yeah. I mean, you know, when we go somewhere, it's always really nice to come home because it's a really beautiful special place. You know, like for example, I went, I just finished work today and I picked up Shasta and in eight minutes I was over on the bluff running on the bluff right next to the ocean. And tomorrow morning I'm gonna go hiking up the mountain with Catherine. And so I think it means, I feel like I'm very blessed because of them surrounded by beauty. And I think it just allows me to do what I love to do. And then of course, it bmeans home because that's where you guys were. That's where we live and where our family is.

Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. 

Adrian: Anything else?

Interviewer: No, that's it. 

Adrian: Okay. Bye.
