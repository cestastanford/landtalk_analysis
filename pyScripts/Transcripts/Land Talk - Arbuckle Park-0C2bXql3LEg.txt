Interviewer: So who are you? And which place are you going to talk about?

Renuka: I am Renuka Sathyamurthy and I am going to talk about Arbuckle Park in Brownsburg, Indiana.

Interviewer: Okay, describe the park for me.

Renuka: Arbuckle Park is a nature park, with beautiful wooded trees, a creek and maybe shelters to have picnics and a playground for the children to play. They also have basketball courts, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds, and jungle gyms.

Interviewer: What did this place used to look like?

Renuka: This Arbuckle Park had shelters mostly for picnics, and quite a few amenities. They did not have a lot of shelters and amenities at that time, 10 or 15 years ago but they were added recently in the last few years. About 10 to 15 years ago, there was only one shelter and one playground, one tennis court, and a basketball court.

Interviewer: Okay. So 10 or 15 years ago, there wasn't much but now they started adding?

Renuka: Yeah, yes they have.

Interviewer: Describe to me how the place has changed in the past 20 years.

Renuka: Yeah, they have a new walking trail that is along the creek. It connects to a large neighborhood and the homeowners make use of that trail. And on top of that, there are multiple shelters that are added for picnics and a grilling station. And there are a number of play areas that are added recently. There is also a bridge over the creek to connect the walking trail. This is a popular site because people take family photos before holiday season, and also for seniors, graduating seniors for high school pictures, high school senior portraits. And another wonderful thing is, for the community, they have added yoga and exercise classes weekly like during summer and spring seasons.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do there?

Renuka: About 10 years ago, I used to bring children to just play in the playground on the days we were off and maybe on the weekends and holidays when friends and family visited us. And the children used to attend birthday parties and picnics in the park too.

Interviewer: What are some things that you do now at the park?

Renuka: We use the park for picnic and hanging out by the creek or under the shelters with my daughter when my family come over, my niece and nephews so we can go over there and hang out. And we also use the walking trail when my friends come over, so we take a group walk together in the nature and it gives us a lot of relaxation. It's great place to walk our dog to and observe the nature at the same time.

Interviewer: All right, thank you.
