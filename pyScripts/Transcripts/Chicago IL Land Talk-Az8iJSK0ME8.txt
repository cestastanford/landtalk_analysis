Sarah: So here I'm interviewing Cindy, who is 51 years old and has lived in Chicago for her whole life. Cindy, what changes have you seen in the area?

Cindy: One of the things that I've noticed that has changed in the last say 20 years or so is the amount of regulatory signs. I mean, literally, you cannot walk down the street without seeing signs like every three or four feet. 

Sarah: And how might that be, like, troublesome, like, environmentally?

Cindy: Well, it's really distracting and it makes everything look so ugly, and it seems to be pretty unnecessary.

Sarah: So generally you're saying that the signs, like, hurt the environment in some way or, like, in general?

Cindy: Actually, yeah. Yeah, it does hurt the environment because when they stick all kinds of metal and stuff into the ground, you know. And then those things rust and they look unsightly. It takes away from the surroundings.

Sarah: Oh, okay. [tape skips 00:01:19] Go ahead.

Cindy: Yeah. Besides that, you know, there are other things that I've noticed. With so many houses that are up, you know. A lot of them are empty. They just sit there and look terrible. You know, there's a lot of garbage on the streets and it's mostly, like, trash from sometimes homeless people. It's just a lot of things like that that I've noticed in the last 20 years. And the streets, for example, first they make the streets narrower because, you know, they're trying to put more...trying to sell stuff outside of stores to get more business. And so, they end up narrowing the streets and then they have all those signs, like I said, street signs, regulatory signs, stop signs, "do not do this" signs, "do not do that" signs. And when they narrow the streets, they say it's to calm the traffic, you know. But then they even narrow the streets more since they have to, like, cut down trees to put the regulatory signs. They put medians in the streets, in the middle, and then they plant trees and flowers in the middle of the street. That might look pretty but, actually, it's a lot of litter and it causes more accidents. So it's not really good for people.

Sarah: Oh, okay. I wanted to ask a question about how, like, an increase in either, like, just buildings in general, not necessarily of their being used or not, has led to, like, destruction of environment. Let's just say, like, if you had a certain park that was taken down because of, you know, urbanization.

Cindy: Oh, yeah. Definitely. There's a lot of that where they'd actually, like, raze parks to put more buildings. Because, you know, rental income is, like, at a premium. So people rent and then they make condos and stuff. It's really hard to even own a house because of so much renting going on. These companies just want to rent stuff out, they don't want to sell you anything. But on top of that, when they do that, for example, like about a mile away from here there was a factory. And around the factory was, like, a nice park area. And the factory had to go out of business because the people who worked there, they were striking and stuff, and they wanted to have more money for the work. And the company had to go out of business because of regulations from about insurance and stuff like that, for how many people you hire. And the company that bought that company actually tore down that whole park, that was a big park. You know, people used to go to picnic there and the people who actually used to work there used to eat lunch there and stuff. Well, they tore it down and they made a big parking lot around the new company, which was a whole little mall type thing with a parking lot. So it really was terrible to see that.

Sarah: And that happened how long ago?

Cindy: Actually, that was back in the '70s. So this was more than 20 years ago, but still they've done it with other things. There's just little malls and little shops popping up all over the place and taking up areas of park and stuff. They try to make it better by building little...I want to call them little islands, but they're more like medians in the middle of streets and stuff, and at corners, that have like two or three trees and a few flowers. And they think that's increasing nature, but it really doesn't help. It just shows how nature is basically becoming obsolete the more people are concentrated in an area, you know.

Sarah: So here I'm interviewing...
