Speaker 1: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. What did Las Alamedas look like in the past?

Speaker 2: Las Alamedas had a lot less classrooms in the past. All those, Miss...Mrs. Neville's room, Mrs. Peterson's room, and I don't know who's in Mrs. Gordon's old room. Those classrooms weren't here when I started teaching at Las Alamedas. No portables were there, none of those buildings were there, the computer lab wasn't here, the library wasn't here. The library was in a classroom. Actually, the library is where the teachers eat their lunch. That's where it used to be. And let me think...There were only 19 teachers.

Speaker 1: Wow.

Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. But the field was the same. We had the field and we had the playground but not the equipment.

Speaker 1: Wow.

Speaker 2: Anything else you wanna know?

Speaker 3: So my question is what has changed about Las Alamedas over the years?

Speaker 2: I think that's what I just said. That we only had 19 teachers back there. We only had about 300 children and now it's over 600 children.

Speaker 3: I thought it was 551.

Speaker 2: It might be today...this year but last year, that last...I haven't been here this year so I don't know. We had a male principal, and we had a female principal, and a female principal, and a female principal, and now we have a male principal.

Speaker 3: Wow. What did people use to do in Downtown Menlo Park?

Speaker 2: Well, pretty much the same thing as they do now. A lot of families, they ride their bikes, they go to the bagel store, they go for coffee but they didn't go to Starbucks because Starbucks wasn't here. Kepler's Bookstore was really tiny and now it's great big and great, great bookstore.

Speaker 3: Thank you for sharing with us.

Speaker 2: Oh. You're quite welcome. Have a great day you guys.

Speaker 1: Thank you.

Speaker 2: Good to see...
