Hi, my name is Linda Stonkey [SP] and I've been living in Clyde Hill, Washington, which is a suburb of Seattle, for the last 28 years. One change that I've seen over the past 20 years is the construction of the 520 bridge, which is located about two minutes from my home. Before the construction, the exit to get to my house had an elevated residential road above the freeway. I used to go for runs a couple times a week, and I would use that sidewalk that was kind of an overpass over the freeway as well as drive, that's where I would go to access getting on and off the freeway. It was just a plain, boring concrete road, a sidewalk with a metal fence on one side. Nothing great to look at, it just was functional. 

About five years ago, the state did a major construction project on this freeway and as a result, they modified the exit and the road running above the freeway. This involved... The exit had a roundabout when you got out, which is very functional to help with the traffic flow when you get on or off the freeway. And additionally, they covered the freeway with what they call a lid, and it's now...it has a park on it, a parking lot on one area, walking trails through the park, which is really nice. It's a nice place to go have picnics. A lot of people take their dogs there, people take their small children. You can often see people throwing balls or kicking soccer balls there. So, it's a useful area. A lot of times I go down there, get a cup of coffee at the nearby coffee shop and walk down there, and it's nice to run into neighbors. So, yeah, I would say that's been a big improvement, and hard to think about how it was before the change. That's it.
