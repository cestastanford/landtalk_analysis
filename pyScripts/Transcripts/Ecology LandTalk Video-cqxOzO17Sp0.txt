So my name is Lucy Beck, and I'm talking about Corona, California and we moved here in 1991, so that is 26 years ago. And at that time Corona was a community of approximately 70,000 people. We lived in about the furthest, the southernmost portion of the community. And there was a half a street behind us and then all behind that was orange groves and then the Cleveland National Forest. There was also a nursery behind as well. And at the end of both ends of our street were orange groves and more orange groves in the surrounding area. So that, we moved in April and it was so fragrant it was almost sickening how the fragrance of the orange blossoms. And today, most of those orange trees are gone. Both ends of our street, the trees are gone, the orchards and also behind us now there are homes that go all the way up to the edge of the Cleveland National Forest; so that's considerably different. And it's interesting last year a friend of ours whose son was doing an Eagle Scout Project and part of that project was to encourage Corona homeowners to plant a citrus tree of some sort, preferably an orange that would bring back the beautiful smell to the city of Corona, because for many years that's sort of what we were famous for. 

In terms of traffic and infrastructure, Corona was very different when we moved here 26 years ago. The freeways were not nearly as crowded, although they were crowded but not nearly as crowded as they are now. And the surface streets were very different, not much traffic at all. Now, a lot of traffic at rush hour times because people are traveling through the community, if the freeways are backed up they come in on the surface streets through Corona. So, also there has been a lot of development of the infrastructure, a lot of strip malls and grocery stores and gas stations and, at the end of our street which used to be the orchard, there is a elementary school. There have been new high schools built to accommodate the increase in population. Today Corona's population is approximately 160,000, so it more than doubled and that doubling took place in about, maybe 15 years after we moved here. It's been pretty stable for the last, maybe 10 years. So they still continue to build but the population coming and going.

So in terms of our house, our house has not changed that much. When we moved into our house there we had one small child, not even two yet and then we raised our family, so three children. And now we are about to become empty nesters again, so our home will be more like when we moved in terms of space. So at the time we moved in we had a lawn in the front and a lawn in the back and we had a big olive tree in the front of our house. All the houses on our street, the development, all the landscaping included an olive tree. Most of those are gone now because they just made such a mess everywhere. They dropped the olives and they were quite oily, so most people have dug those up and gotten rid of them. 

Another thing that has changed in terms of landscaping is, many people used to have Jacaranda trees which are beautiful purple flowering, they have beautiful purple flowers in the spring. But again they made such a mess that many people tore them out and have replaced them. We used to have just a small sort of L shaped concrete walkway up to our front door. And then we had in 1998, we redid the entire landscaping in our front, we had new concrete poured, we had the trees taken out and we just had lawn put in. We also had two big tall King Palm Trees in the front. We had those removed because again they drop so much and they have big seed pods a few times a year. And they would drop those and it would make a big mess, little palm trees everywhere, so we had those taken out. So we're in the process again of redoing it again because now with the drought, we're being encouraged to get rid of the lawn. So we are going to be putting in a border with drought tolerant plants and probably rock of some sort and then we're debating whether to put in less turf or to put in fake artificial turf. And the same with the back. When we moved in there was just dirt in the back and we had sod put down because for our kids, and now we've let that go and we're gonna be doing more hardscape in the backyard again, because of the drought. So the climate has...it hasn't really changed considerably. Although here in Corona, the week we moved in in 1991 it was 108 degrees and that was quite a shock to people who had come from San Diego. Of course, we all have air conditioning up here but it was almost impossible to go outside and do anything in 108-degree temperatures. If anything we haven't had a week like that week at all since we moved in, especially not in April but with the drought conditions in California the water became a real issue. 

So, let's see, what did we use to do here? We really just did things sort of traditional things with the family. Take the kids to school, we did mommy and me classes at the local parks and rec, the kids played sports with the park and rec, school-based activities. My kids, all three of them went to school here in Corona, lots of different schools. What else did we use to do? We've never done a lot of family activities here in Corona, there's not a whole lot to do as a family. We used to always go to the 4th of July firework show, it used to be at Corona High School, and we would go to the one of the parks nearby or one of the schools and sit out, and you could always hear the music playing and watch the fireworks. Now they do that at one of the big community parks, not at the high school and we've never done that. It's always a parking nightmare, so we've sort of stayed away. We can always walk somewhere close enough when it was at the high school. So we didn't really do a whole lot of community-based activities and we still don't.

Let's see, how else has Corona changed? We used to have...our city hall was at the old high school. In 1960-61, the high school moved to its new location and the old high school building became the Civic Center, it sort of had a lot of character. And they build a new civic center behind that, so now the...I don't know what the old high school is used for,  the building is still there. But all the civic center activities are in the new building. And the city itself has really expanded. They've built out. A lot of the South Corona infrastructure there's just lots and lots of houses and now all that housing is extending down the 15 Freeway. When we first moved here I worked in San Diego and I used to go down there once a week. And I could just zip down the 15 Freeway and be in La Mesa which is actually east of San Diego in about an hour and 15 minutes. And now at any time of the day, we could just be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic on the 15 Freeway all the way down to Lake Elsinore which is 20 minutes down the freeway. And there's so much building down there. There used to be just nothing, it was barren. So lots of communities down there and it makes the traffic really, really, difficult especially at rush hours, but even not at rush hour. So, the traffic is a big huge change. Let's see...
