Interviewer: How did this place look before? How did Camp Muir look when you first went there?

Interviewee: I was first at Camp Muir in 1974. I was 16 and what I really remember is that actual approach to Camp Muir and that there was a huge amount of snow on either side of it and the rock. There was a rock outcropping that you had to hike up to but that the hike up was very gradual, and there was a lot of snow on either side of it.

  
Interviewer: Interesting. And how's it changed since then?

  
Interviewee: Well, I've been back there many, many times. And I definitely noticed more recently when I've been up there that it's not a gradual approach anymore. It's much steeper, which suggests to me that even though it's a permanent snowfield at 10,000 feet, that the snow is melting and it's a much steeper ascent that you have to kind of hike up quite a ways to get to the rock outcropping and to the shelters at Camp Muir.

Interviewer: I mean, you've been going here for a very, very long time. So what are kind of the things that you used to do here first couple of times you went?

Interviewee: Had fun, I mean, as a teenager I was just happy to be there. What I do there hasn't really changed that much, although I don't move anywhere near as quickly. No one moves quickly at 10,000 feet, even if they think they will. But they, there's not a lot there. It's a public shelter that where people stay when they're getting ready to climb the mountain. So when I was there as a teenager, I was just happy and light-headed and having a lot of fun. I was actually working there for a week. So I guess that would be the answer to what I did. I was at work throughout there. I came back many more times. Sometimes to visit friends, other times because I was climbing the mountain myself. I would stay either in the public shelter or I would pitch a tent on the other side, which is what a lot of people did.

Interviewer: How's that changed? What are the things that you do nowadays there?

Interviewee: Well, I don't get there very often, it's a long hike. But as far as what I do there really hasn't changed that much. As I mentioned, when I was there first as a teenager, I worked there for a week and that I was working. I was working for the Park Service. Whereas when I came back many times over the years later, I was with a climbing group. And so I was staying there in the shelter and learning various crevass rescue. And so, what I do there isn't that different than what I did years ago. Many times now, if I were to go up there, I would just go up there and relax and have lunch and go back down.

Interviewer: Awesome. That's perfect. Thank you.
