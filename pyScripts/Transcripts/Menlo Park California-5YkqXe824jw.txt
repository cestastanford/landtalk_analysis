Interviewer: Hi, we are interviewing our guests about Menlo Park, California. Can you describe what Los Lomitas used to look like?

Interviewee: Los Lomitas was much smaller when I first came to teach here. There was no two-story building, no computer lab or library. All of this area was open field and there were big redwood tree grove. There was a big redwood tree grove out here where the kids would have their lunch and big play structures where kids could take books up high on these little kind of fort like levels and sit up there and read. It was pretty cool. It's really nice. There are a lot more buildings, a lot more students and teachers, but there's a lot more energy now and it's a lot of fun. Yeah.

Interviewer: How does Los Lomitas look now?

Interviewee: Well, Los Lomitas has grown for sure, right? Now there's this two-story building here which wasn't there before, and when that building got built they started like they did with these buildings that they're building for you now. They started by putting big pillars of steel up and one day they let all the teachers and all the students go over and write their names on the pillars. And then they continued building until all the names were covered up by the classrooms and the buildings and the hallways now. It's pretty fun. 

Interviewer: How has Los Lomitas changed?

Interviewee: Well, it's changed like I said by getting so much bigger. It's just huge. All the buildings are huge and the property's gotten bigger too. All this property where they're building right now, that didn't belong to Los Lomitas, that was somebody's home. Yeah.

Interviewer: What does Kepler's Bookstore look like now?

Interviewee: Well, Kepler's Bookstore is bigger now than it used to be. And it used to be when you went in there, there were just books. That was it. And now you can go and you can buy jewelry, and you can buy some games, and you can buy purses and all kinds of things. And the children's department is more than double in its size now. They have activities to do there in the children's department which they never had before. So, it's gotten bigger too.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing with us.

Interviewee: You're so welcome.
