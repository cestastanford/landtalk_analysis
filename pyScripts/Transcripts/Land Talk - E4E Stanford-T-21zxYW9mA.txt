Interviewer: So, when we first moved in, how did it look...how did this place look before than it does now?

Interviewee: Wow. Right out of the gate. That is an interesting question to try and recall what something looked like 20 years ago. I'm going to answer using, like, the neighborhood. And by the "neighborhood," I mean kind of the greater, you know, block two, Olympic block of Pico and stretches of Pico because we live in a suburban neighborhood, but the suburban neighborhood is a block away from a commercial strip on one side and another commercial strip three blocks away to the east and two blocks away to the west. So, the neighborhood is I would say relatively...and, you know, there aren't any major significant changes. The changes are a lot more subtle. So, I can really only answer the question, what did it look like 20 years ago, by telling you the differences. You know, what's happened to this area in the last 20 years? But 20 years ago, it was the same. There were houses, single-family dwelling houses. And there was retail on Pico. So, the quick answer to your question is, 20 years ago it was similar. It wasn't the same. It was similar to the way it is now.

Interviewer: Yeah, I mean, the follow-up question to how did it look before was how has it changed? So, like, you know, people started coming in. What kinds of shops? Like, you know, 20 years ago, internet, and phones, and like all of that stuff wasn't a big thing. So, like has there been a change in...

Interviewee: All right. So, in our immediate neighborhood residentially, I think there are now incrementally more families of Asian descent than there were before, number one. Number two is that there are a number of houses that were either torn down and a kind of much bigger two-story house was built or people added on and added a second story, and like ate up their own green space. So, I think that, you know, at least on our street and on Camden and on Veteran, and on...you know, in our immediate neighborhood, there are absolutely more bigger, two-story houses that in a lot of cases just are overbuilt on the lot. That was kind of the first wave.

The second wave, and there are a number of these now in this neighborhood, is what I would call like the box house. It's not a traditional angled roof. It's not a traditional shake roof. It's not a traditional shingle roof. These are modern boxes. And there are all kinds of them, not just in our neighborhood, but throughout the city. But that's how you know that this thing...that, you know, the house is new in the last five years. One of the indications is that it's boxy. There have definitely been some traditional, you know, homes... I can think of two immediately new big traditional homes that were built in our neighborhood.

And, on our stretch of Pico in the commercial district, we've seen more eating establishments. And over the last 20 years the, Westside Pavilion extension was built, where the movie theaters and the Westside Tavern was built. And we've gained a couple of strip malls in the last 20 years. Where the yogurt place, Big Chill, and where the Starbucks is, there was a very, very, very traditional ice cream store there, Baskin-Robbins. That's now gone and hasn't been replaced. There's the stretch of Westwood Boulevard below Tennessee has seen all kinds of retail change. There are now more exercise places than there were before. The traditional retailers like the Frame Store, you know, that guy's gone. But there's a restaurant there, two restaurants, Hoboken and Mateos and then the deli that had been there for, you know, 40 or 50 years. So, our neighborhood is similar. I'd say it's more unchanged than it is changed. It's not like a wholesale revolution of change.

Interviewer: Like, that's a lot of building and like retail and sort of like consumer change. Like, what kind of environmental changes have you noticed either in just our own backyard because obviously like we redid it for a reason. So, like when I was younger, like describe, like, sort of the difference between how it was when I was younger and even just like the environment of the neighborhood and how you noticed that it's different now.

Interviewee: Well, over the last 20 years in our house, we went through a remodel and our back yard used to have lawn. And, the tough thing about having a lawn on our property is that our backyard doesn't get a lot of sunlight. So, you know, the grass needed a lot of care. And when we redid the back yard, we decided that we were going to, you know, basically put the patio deck out there to give ourselves another room. You know, during the summer and fall, that's an entire...that's another room. You know, it's a dining entertaining area essentially. 

Interviewer: Right.

Interviewee: And, the back yard has a lot of...it doesn't have green grass anymore. It's got plants on it. And, in the neighborhood, you know, we went through a drought, so a couple, I would say half a dozen, maybe a dozen houses, you know, went to a hardscape and went to a desert scape. And, I can think of at least one that put in artificial grass. So, people did...different homeowners reacted to environmental changes on their individual property by changing the landscaping.

Interviewer: Yeah, that's some good stuff right there. This is for an ecology class. So that's why I asked you specifically about like environment. What are some of the things that you used to do in this environment or in this location that you don't do now? What are some things that you do now that you didn't do back then?

Interviewee: Well, I used to walk with small children and ride bikes with small children. And I don't do that anymore. I have consistently for the last 20 years walked the dog in this neighborhood. And now, I walk for pure exercise in this neighborhood. So I think it's safe to say that I'm also using more local restaurants than we used to because there just are more local restaurants than there used to be.

Interviewer: Yeah. True. Do you say you use our back yard more than you did when we were younger? And if so, like if not, why not? And if so, are you using it differently or are you using it for similar purposes?

Interviewee: The back yard, when we first moved in and it was grass, you know, for the first 10 years, was used primarily for little kids to run around and for birthday parties. And after we put the patio deck in, it has become an important location for entertaining. There have been countless dinner parties out there and, formal dinner parties, you know, formally-seated dinner parties. So, the nature of the...yeah, the way we use the space has changed because we changed it from grass a patio deck.
