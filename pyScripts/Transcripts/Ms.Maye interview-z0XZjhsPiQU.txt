Interviewer: Hi.

Interviewee: Hello. 

Interviewer: So please introduce yourself. 

Interviewee: My name is Marcia Holmes-Maye, and I'm a science, geometry teacher here at Northwestern Senior High School. 

Interviewer: All right. So today we're here to talk about the Ashburton community in Baltimore City and the changes that you've seen since you moved in since you grew up there. So tell us about how the community was when you lived there, and when that was.

Interviewee: Okay. So I was born in 1964 and I lived in the same house from 1964 to 1982, when I left and went away to college. And then I moved back in 2011, and I currently live there now. So when I was kid, the community was very different in the sense that we had archway trees, and the trees would be in a median strip and they formed an arch with the trees that were on the sidewalk portion of people's houses. They were Dutch elm trees, so they would go up and then they formed an arch. 

So if you came down our street it looked like you were, you know, going down an archway, so it was really pretty. Somewhere, I guess it was like around like 1982, '83, somewhere around there, that they got Dutch elm disease. So most of the trees died. They had to come down. So then they replaced the trees a little later on, maybe, I guess like late 1997, '98 they started replacing them with different trees, but they still weren't taking. 

So somewhere about 15 years ago, they started putting apple trees in the middle. So now we have a lot of apple trees and other fruit trees in the middle where the median strip is, but they're not tall enough, of course, to grow over. So we don't have the archway. And then, the trees that they cut down people's sidewalks, they're completely gone. So we have some crape myrtles and different miscellaneous trees now, depending upon the people wanting the trees or not. 

So as far as how the community's changed, in that respect, the trees, just looking at it, is very different. And we're now considered a historic community. So before, we had like a neighborhood association, but it wasn't very strong, but now it's pretty strong. So they're trying to impose different regulations so that people's homes will be looking like we were from a historical time as opposed to, you know, just any kinda house, any kinda way. So you have to get things approved before you make changes.

Interviewer: Right. Okay, and what was your favorite part of all living there in the 1970s and '80s?

Interviewee: You could go play...Like, we didn't have any fences on the front yards and it was very few fences on the back. So you could just like run and play over your friend's house. If I wanted to go to my buddy's house, I can just go behind my house and go through. You know, you cross the street. It wasn't so much traffic as it is now.

And it was a lot...I don't know. You knew everybody in the neighborhood. So we all grew up there. So my parents were real comfortable with me going across the street or I could go down the street. But now when my grandkids come, it's very different because a lot of the houses have fences. We don't know a lot of the neighbors now because a lot of people passed. And, you know, there are people there, but they're not as friendly as they used to be. And then you have to be careful. And just the makeup of knowing the people. So if I don't know the people, like I won't let the kids run, you know, everybody's house because I don't know them. So it's different in that respect.

Interviewer: Right. And has, like, the demographic of your community changed? Like, were there like a certain group of people like Hispanics or African Americans, like during that time and now? Has that changed?

Interviewee: Okay, so when I was born, the neighborhood was changing over. It used to be completely Jewish, and then African Americans started moving in, and then the Jewish people started moving out, and they were moving towards like Pikeville in the suburbs. So then, when I was growing up, most of the time, it was mostly African American. Now we moved back in 2011. Between 2011 and maybe when we had the...2008 when they had the...

Interviewer: The recession?

Interviewee: Yeah, the recession and a lot of people lost their houses and stuff. Since then, our neighborhood's been one that's been...they've flipped a lot of houses. So we have a lot of different kinda people that are in because like we have majority African Americans still, but we have like Europeans in. We have people who are...there's like the same sex that are in the houses now. We have a couple of Asian people that are there. We have Hispanics that are there. So it's a lot more multicultural now, but it's still predominantly African American. But we noticed, like, as the houses are being flipped, it's all different kinds of nationalities that are moving in. 

Interviewer: Right. And in terms of like the infrastructure, how has it changed? Like the roads, the buildings, you know, the schools.

Interviewee: So, the schools, we used to have...every school used to have a recreation center. A lot of the recreation centers closed. Now our recreation center is called Callaway Elementary School, and then Webster Kendrick is the actual recreation center. And that just got renovated and it is beautiful. I mean, like they went and they did a whole inside, outside. It's just completely different. And we have Boys & Girls Club there. 

So it was really nice to see that change because it was really thriving when we were little, and then they closed a lot of the recreation centers. So within the last, I don't know, I guess about 10 or 12 years, the kids were going, but it needed to be fixed. And now it's just beautiful. I love it. I don't know what they're going to do with the school. They need to renovate the school too, but the rec center looks good. I can't remember.

Interviewer: Yeah, that's fine. That's enough information. How about like in terms of the weather? 

Interviewee: Okay, so when we were little, it snowed a lot more than it snows now, and it snows deeper. Like kids now get out of school if it's like four or five inches of snow. We couldn't get out of school when we were little and until it was like...it had to be deep like nine inches of snow or something. I guess that's because people sue people so much now, but yeah, we didn't get out of school. Like how we have school snow days here...

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: ...I think we had like one, maybe two, snow days a year. We had a lot of blizzards and stuff then when I was like young. Now, you know, I don't know. The neighbors do help a lot. Like when the weather's bad, they help shovel out each other's snow. So that's a good thing. But we don't get a whole lot of blizzards, but we did get one. Like in 2008, we got one and then we got one a couple years ago. It was like 30 inches of snow. But it's rare. Like the snow is not as consistent as it used to be.

And then we get a lot more...I think our weather is a lot different. Like it used to be, the winter was cold, you had a spring, and you had a summer, and you had a fall. But now it's like, in any given day, you're like, "What season?" Because like it was cold yesterday and now it's hot again. So the weather fluctuates a lot more than it did when I was younger. But that could be for a whole lot of reasons. It could've been global warming, you know? But that's one thing that I know is different with the weather. 

Interviewer: Right. How about when you...because you lived the there when you're a teenager until you, like, you moved to college, what like activities did you do like for entertainment, and what activities do you do now, or your children and grandchildren do now? 

Interviewee: Well, when I lived there for high school, I didn't go to a neighborhood school. I went to private school. So all my, like, activities were school-based mostly. I drove, so I would just go wherever the activity was. Some of the stuff was in the neighborhood, but mostly, once I was in middle school, most of my activities were school-related. 

Interviewer: Right. So like, were you able to, like, go out? Were there like as many malls or...?

Interviewee: Okay, so our mall was very different. We had a mall that was called Reisterstown Plaza and we had Mondawmin Mall. Mondawmin Mall was the oldest mall in our nation. It was the oldest indoor mall in the nation, the first. And it was cool because it had like a lot of the department stores. Like it had, [inaudible 00:08:45], Humberger's [SP]. It had stores that they don't have anymore. It had a lot of the, I guess you call them high-end department stores. Whereas now just like Mondawmin, for example, it's still indoors. They renovated, it looks really nice, but it doesn't have a whole lot of major stores, you know? It has like local little small stores.

And then Reisterstown Plaza used to have a whole lot of stores. First, it was an outdoor one, and then they changed it to indoor, and now it's back to outdoor because it's like, I don't know, the Rouse [SP] Company or something came and changed it. So it's completely changed. So it's been kind of neat to see that because that's been a big change. When we were little, it used to have a little courtyard that went from one end of the shopping area to the other. And, you know, we loved it. But it did have big department stores. They had like like Stewart's, [inaudible 00:09:39]. Hamburger's wasn't a department store, but it was a popular chain. And now we have the Burlington Coat Factory, and then the other stores that are in there are small little like boutiquey-type shops. And it has a food court. But it has like the community college in there. The nursing board is there. So it has more agencies there now than it does stores. So that's the big change.

Interviewer: Right. How about, like, when it comes to, like, the economy, like, how has the price of items changed over time? Like things were like a lot cheaper, and like [crosstalk 00:10:17].

Interviewee: Well, just overall because you know, I've been around for a lot of years. But we had a lot more corner stores. We had little, you know, like, privately owned mom-and-pop type stores. And they were owned by a lot of the people that lived in the community. Whereas now, the corner stores are owned by people who don't live in the neighborhood. So they could be owned by, you know, different nationalities but that was...I know we had two drug stores, we had a liquor store, we had a Chinese store, post office, and then it changed over, then the post office came back. So it's kinda neat that, by me leaving like growing up, leaving and coming back, some stuff is improving for the better, and some stuff, it's just like like my kids will never know about it because it's, you know, they don't have it.

Interviewer: Right. So what do you, like, really miss about living in that place back when you were, like, in high school? What do you miss about it, that you can't have now for yourself or for your children? 

Interviewee: Well, what I miss is that the safety factor, I think, was a lot better then. I felt like it was a lot more safe there. We didn't have, like, the gun violence. Like I don't experience a whole lot of gun violence in my actual block or two, but like right around the corner, it's a lot of shooting. And I would like to see, you know, them to figure out how they can resolve the violence in our city because a lot of people leave because of the violence.

Interviewer: For safety. Yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah, for their safety. 

Interviewer: Right. And how about, like, back then, how was, like, the emphasis on education? Do you think that because now education has not been given the same value that teenagers or young people resort to, you know, violence and shootings and everything? Do you think the value of education has changed?

Interviewee: Well, I don't think....the value of education has definitely changed. A lot of the kids go to charter schools or we have citywide schools. So the students who are a lot more focused on education tend to go to the schools that are citywide schools where everybody in the city has to compete in order to get into that school. So those schools were like that when I was younger too. 

But it was a lot more...Like the middle schools were called junior high schools when I was little. So the junior high schools took everybody. They weren't segregated based on, you know, if you want to be a tech school or arts-integrated school. It was just, "These are the high schools, these are the middle schools, elementary." And if you were, like, top of your class, you could go to like the polytechnic, the west end of of the city. Those were the only three schools in the whole city that everybody was trying to get into.

So now I think it's better in the respect that you have schools based on your interests. Like if you're into fashion design, there's schools that have that as a charter or chapter. We have schools if you're musically inclined. But some of the schools, even though they're based on your interest, don't get the same funding as some of the other schools get. So it's not too equal. So I think that that would be something that, I will say, is as a difference. Some of it is a good difference, and some of it's not too good of a difference. Like we have...like I have children that are in middle school, and if they don't go to the charter schools like, "Oh my God, where are they gonna go?" So that's a concern.

Interviewer: Right. Since you went back in 2011, and now you've been there for like eight years now, what have you realized that you like about the place, or what do you like to do there since you have gone back? Shopping or, you know, hanging out with friends?

Interviewee: Well, I know the...I like the subway, that you can get...Like I can keep my car parked at home and just walk to the subway station. When I was a teenager, the subway station was new, just coming up. But it wasn't like...

Interviewer: Not the way it used to be?

Interviewee: Yeah. Well, it was nice and clean because it was brand new, but a lot of people weren't familiar with it. And it didn't connect [inaudible 00:14:33] this way. So ours goes north and south, and now it's extended and we have a light rail system too. So it's expanded. The subways system has expanded and it also is in conjunction with the light rail. So instead of just going north and south, you can also go east and west, you can go all the way out to the airport. 

Interviewer: Right. How about like as, like, hobbies or, like, for entertainment, what do since you went back?

Interviewee: Down at the harbor, they have a lot more stuff. We have a place called [inaudible 00:15:05] Canton, there's things that you can do. It's a lot more art district-y type stuff because I'm crafty, so I like the art district. So we have more art districts. And we may have had them back in the day, but I just was young, so I didn't know about them, so I seek them out now. And I think it's a lot more activities that we can do now compared...

Okay, so as an adult, there are more activities. But I think for the children, there are a lot less activities. Like I ran track with Jesse Owens, we did a whole lot of stuff through the recs, and we did the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, and I don't see that they have those opportunities. They do still have Boys & Girls Club and they do have Girl Scouts, but you had to go so far, whereas it used to be like at the neighborhood church. But now you gotta go, maybe 15, 20 minutes away. So I think there's not as many activities for the children as they should have.

Interviewer: And so, finally, while you were there in the 1970s and now, and you know, late 2000s, what has remained the same in the community in terms of the people or like the infrastructure or the values, you know [inaudible 00:16:15]? 

Interviewee: Well, the neighborhood that I live in now is still considered like one of the...well, we call it popular neighborhoods to move in, like the values of the homes, so pretty much have retained their value. People coming in and flipping like the houses that were not in good shape and fix them up. Because people get older, they pass, the children don't want the houses or whatever. So we have a lot of people who have been flipping the houses and that's helped with the market. The cost of the house has gone up, the value of the house has gone up. So that would be a good thing. 

And then one other thing I think has stayed the same is, for the most part, the homeowners, the people who are actually buying the homes, they look at our neighborhood as a good place to be. So they wanted, you know, to put improvements for their children. So I think that's good. It's still a family-oriented area. 

Interviewer: [inaudible 00:17:07]

Interviewee: Yeah, but we still like to get to know each other but I don't think...that would be nice if people could start meeting their neighbors a little bit more. I think that would be great. 

Interviewer: All right. So that is it, Ms. Maye. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

Interviewee: Okay. You're welcome.
