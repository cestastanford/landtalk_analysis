Interviewer: So dad, why don't you introduce yourself?

Chris: My name is Chris Rar, R-A-R. I grew up and lived in Australia for 24 years, and then currently the last 30 are living in the United States and visit Australia every year, almost.

Interviewer: Okay. What's the name of the town that you grew up in?

Chris: I grew up in a small sugarcane farming town called Ayr, spelled A-Y-R. It's in North Queensland. It's about eight miles inland from the coast and it's an agricultural area in the tropics with the barrier reef is the probably the main international attraction there.

Interviewer: Yeah. About 40 miles off the coast?

Chris: No, about eight.

Interviewer: Eight?

Chris: Yes, that's all.

Interviewer: Wow. Okay. So well, I'm gonna be asking you about Phillip's. I've been there plenty of times, but obviously, you grew up there. How did it look probably when you were about 10? Like how do you think...how did it look?

Chris: I can remember it now still kind of vividly. It was kind of like an adventure every time we went, but everything  was green. The water was always deeper. And there was always an abundance of crabs and prawns and even small fishing was really good back 30, 40 years ago. But the overall...the look of the landscape was definitely greener and the waters were much deeper than they are now.

Interviewer: Okay. What types of fish would you fish for in Phillip's?

Chris: Okay. And I think it's changed a little bit, but back in the earlier days, and I'm not sure if the United States has these species, but bream and whiting and also there was a little bit of snapper. There was flathead was huge back then and there were mud...and they've almost all gone now. But flathead was delicious eating. Those probably they were the main species, but bream, flathead, whiting and snapper.

Interviewer: Okay. So how do you think it's changed from that point and compared to now?

Chris: Well, the by far biggest overall ecological change has to be the movement of the channels. And the channel, I think, for people that aren't aware, a channel is basically the deepest part of a creek or estuary or river where the waters flow in and out based on the tide. And that has changed dramatically probably three or four times in the last 30, 40 years. And what that's done too is, especially in Phillip's creek, which is what we're talking about, for some reason, it's moved just thousands and thousands of tons of sand into the creek and estuary. And it's basically made it probably between two and four-foot shallower than it was 30 years ago, which is significant in a creek because typically on the deepest part of the creek in North Queensland, the one I'm talking about is Philip's, it can be four, six, eight-foot deep.

But there's a lot of cases where it's just two, three, four-foot deep in, you know, the main parts of the channel. And then, of course, it tapers off to the banks. So that can be reduced to practically sand and a couple of feet of water in high tide, you know, of course, depending on the size of the tide. But the bottom line is millions of tons of sand have moved into the creek, which has, you know, obviously changed the type of species that thrive in that kind of more sandy environment, too, underwater I'm talking.

Interviewer: Yeah. Great. Well, you talked a little bit about fishing and we've gone crabbing there a couple of times. But what are some of the other things that you used to do there other than fishing and crabbing?

Chris: I mean, when we were younger too, we used to camp by the creek side and do our own crabbing and fishing. But we also used to, and I forgot about this, and this is actually significant, families would get together and we would have like a Saturday, [inaudible 00:05:57] they're called in Australia, you know, on the creek front. We'd all get together and barbeque and whatever and we would water ski and toboggan and tow, you know, all the kids and the grandkids and everyone would just have fun. There would be three or four boats and everyone would take turns either water skiing or mainly tobogganing, you know?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Chris: Tubing and just having a great time, you know, in and out of the water. Well, that's all gone now because the creek is just too shallow. There's just not enough room to turn and maneuver boats anymore. So, you know, we did many weekends and Christmases doing that and that was terrific fun. And at the same time, some of the families would go and set crab pots that we would check, you know, before, during, and even after when, you know, kids go back to school. Some of them would stay an extra day or two if they had vacation, and did crabbing as well in between the hanging out and, you know, just tubing, having fun on the water, swimming even, because there was, you know, there were sandy parts as well as muddy parts. And of course, we as kids and other kids, were just hanging out on the sandy parts, and it was fun.

Interviewer: Yeah. So you said that the depth of the creek itself has gotten so shallow that you are not able to, you know, do these fun activities like skiing, tobogganing, tubing and stuff like that. What are some things that you would do there now?

Chris: Okay. Well, we're doing the whole tubing, tobogganing, just you never see it anymore. But the fishing has become a little bit better with regard to like ocean fish and sand-based feeding fish that are coming in from the Pacific Ocean closer towards the mouth of the creek. The fishing has improved and there are a few more species coming in like off the reef that like feed on the edge of the reef, which is about 10 miles out in the ocean, so the fishing has improved a little bit. And also, in season prawning, orshrimp, prawns, they're called in Australia, prawning has increased and gotten better because of the increase in sand overall because I guess these types of prawns that live there thrive on a more sandy environment.

But what that's done is that's pushed the crabs somewhere else, the mud crabs, that's what they call the crabs thrive and exist in muddy conditions, mangrove conditions. So they've had to migrate further and further up the shallower little creeks, which makes them harder to catch, harder to, you know, catch basically. So the overall like fishing, crabbing environment has changed from an improved like ocean fish to creek fish, they've kind of disappeared too. They've moved further up into these little creeks where you can hardly even get in with a boat. But the ocean fish have kind of taken over at least the mouth area for fishing.

And the crabs have moved further up into the muddy areas. And a lot of those muddy areas actually have been created due to the sand coming in and the tidal changes. New, smaller creeks have been formed over the last 30, 40 years. So it's kind of...and actually, some of the larger like creek estuaries, like run-offs from the main mouth of the Philip's, there's two of them, I think, that have been blocked off completely except from extremely high tides where you used to be able to take your boat, you know, a mile or two up into them and do your fishing and crabbing there, you know, they're gone.

So basically, the crabs have migrated into shallower, muddier waters. And the creek fish have kind of moved similarly, into shallower, smaller little creeks, some new, some existing, that were just too small to, you know, maneuver boats and whatever into. And it's become overall more sandy and shallower is the bottom line.

Interviewer: Awesome. Well, that's everything I need from you. I'll let you know if I need anything else. I really appreciate it.

Chris: No problem. And then the only other thing like with regard to the landscape and, you now, the ecology side, the overall, there's a lot more debris, a lot more like dead limbs. It's a lot drier above the water. You know, there's still mangrove. But where there used to be probably 5 to 10% were just, you know, mangrove debris, you know, with plants and trees and shrubs die, of course, mangrove over time, the new ones replenish. Well, it's probably 60%, 40% now of green and dead, brown limbs as opposed to approximately like 90% green mangrove and, you know, 10%, you know, die off. And that's kind of significant to look at. You know, because everyone wants to look at green, you know, landscaping and blue water. Well, the water is a nicer color now because there is less mud. But, you know, it just means less crabs. So it's a trade off.

Interviewer: Yeah. Awesome. That's, well, above and beyond what I needed, but that's awesome. I mean, all that makes sense too, so it's pretty cool.

Chris: It's the whole truth.

Interviewer: Yeah. Well yeah, obviously.

Chris: All right.

Interviewer: Cool. Well...
