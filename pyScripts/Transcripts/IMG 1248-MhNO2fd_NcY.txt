Quinn: I'll be recording a video of my audio files since YouTube is making it very difficult for me to upload my audio file. So... 

Pax: Hello?

Quinn: Hello, Uncle Pax [SP]. How you doing?

Pax: What's up, Quinn [SP]?

Quinn: How you been?

Pax: Stop. Stop. Oh, dude, I've been good. I've been good. What about you?

Quinn: I'm doing all right. I actually have to do a quick, little interview for one of my biology classes, and I feel like you're the perfect guy for the job. So do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

Pax: Oh, of course, dude. Once I get my dog out of the way. He's annoying me. All right. What's up?

Quinn: So you've been living in Austin for over 20 years now, right?

Pax: Yes. It's been about 20, 21 years. 

Quinn: 21 years. That's right. And so how's that been?

Pax: Oh, you know, it's been great. I haven't had a reason to move. So I've just been planted there with my family for the past 20 years. Had some kids there. City hasn't really changed much, but it's been a great place to live and grow up.

Quinn: Yeah, so how do the kids like it there? What kind of activities are they involved in?

Pax: Well, it's super-hot there, so I'm currently not there right now. I'm out of town on a business trip. But normally, you see 100-degree weather basically May through October. And then it will get cold during the winter. So there is a lot of summertime activities. The kids are all involved in sports, some in rowing, some in swimming. They can basically swim year-round. But it's a great little utopia. There's a fun downtown area that we always take the kids to. Me and my wife actually aren't together right now, but that was definitely an activity that we liked to do, too.

Quinn: That's great. Do you like... Do you think... Have you seen any changes in the last 20 years in, like, anything specific, like weather or, like, kinda community or anything that's, like, noteworthy?

Pax: Well, I wish the infrastructure has changed because there has been more than 400,000 people move into Austin but they haven't changed, you know, the dang roads. So there is a lot of traffic there. As far as weather goes, it's been 100 degrees every summer for as long as I can remember. I want to say it's been getting warmer, but to be honest, I really don't know just because it's been so similar. 

I remember a few years back there was definitely a warmer streak where we had, like, 40, 45 days in a row of...like, we broke the record in the United States for the most days...most consecutive days above 100 degrees. And that was maybe two or three summers ago. But that's the only noticeable change that I've observed.

Quinn: Oh, wow. No, it definitely sounds like a very lively and active place to live in. So I don't really have any more questions. I kind of just wanted to check in, see how everything is going. It sounds like you guys are all doing pretty well over there in Austin. And everything is going all right. So good luck to you and the kids. 

Pax: All right, man. Well, we'd love to have you come visit sometime. Thank you for the interview.

Quinn: Tell the Pop Jackson [SP] I say hello.

Pax: Oh, absolutely. 

Quinn: All right. Thank you, Pax.

Pax: Bye, man.

Quinn: Bye.
