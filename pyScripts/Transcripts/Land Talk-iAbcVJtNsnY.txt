Interviewer: Okay. So, how did this place look before?

Interviewee: First of all, we need to identify the place, right? So, the place we're gonna talk about is in the corner of El Camino in San Antonio. I think it used to be called the San Antonio Shopping Center, but I'm not sure. Well, this place...it used to look kind of old, I would say. And the main feature of this shopping center was Sears that was here when we first moved here in 1999. And that is one of my favorite places to go is to Sears, and that's right. And also close to this area, I remember there's Hunan Restaurant that is also our favorite restaurant as well. That's no longer here. What else I'd see? 

Interviewer: Was it pretty? 

Interviewee: Which one, the Sears?

Interviewer: The shopping center.

Interviewee: No, the shopping center I would say a typical...you know what, it was not upscale shopping center. It was just, you know, it's not like upscale. I would say average shopping center. It does look old.

Interviewer: How has it changed?

Interviewee: Well, I know when Sears closed. And now they have all of the new development, very upscale [inaudible 00:01:35] look very expensive. So that is the major change I noticed. And also in is area, there used to be a Safeway that mall like twin, you know, like one-story [inaudible 00:01:48] old, 30- years-old Safeway. And I would like a lot. Now they have a new Safeway that are a lot more upscale and new, but for some reason, it doesn't feel the same. So, we don't like it as much.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do there?

Interviewee: Well, I used to go there for, like I said, Sears. So, my favorite place to buy is at Sears, so I go there to buy tools. I would go there to buy...sometimes we buy clothes from there, electronics, TVs, and typical gardening stuff, you know, gardening equipment, and car repair, tools, and stuff. So, that was one of my favorite things to do.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you do there now?

Interviewer: Well, now I don't go there as often, because Sears is not there, and, actually I think that by now I'm old. Another thing, there used to be a shop in there that turned into the 24 Hour Fitness. That used to be, I think, a Payless shopping center and now become a 24 Hour Fitness. So, we used to go there to shop for food, but now I go there to exercise. So, now let me see. I go there for to go to... That's a warm [inaudible 00:03:35]. I didn't use to go there. That's it.

Interviewer: Cool.

Interviewee: That's it.

Interviewer: Yup.
