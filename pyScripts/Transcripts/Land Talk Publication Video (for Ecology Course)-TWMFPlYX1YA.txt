Interviewer: Hi. I'm here with Helen Fitzgerald.

Helen: Hello.

Interviewer: We are here to talk about how over the past 20 years her front yard has changed. Helen, would you mind describing for us what your front yard used to look like 20 years ago?

Helen: Sure, we are the original owners. We built our home. The builder put in the original landscaping with two small oak trees at that time.

Interviewer: What other plants were in your front yard?

Helen: Sod, for the grass, a variety of crepe myrtles and various plants and flowers in addition to the two oak trees.

Interviewer: Now when looking at today, how would you say your front yard has changed?

Helen: To be honest, 25 years later a lot of the plants had fulfilled their full lifespan. We've had to replace most of the front yard. The oak trees have gotten so large that their roots have actually come up out of the ground and ruined a lot of the grass that we've had to replace as well. Since the oak trees grew, it has provided shade over the yard and killed a lot of the shrubbery that also needed replaced. This has also created an infestation of squirrels that love the oak trees and also getting into our roof and attic, unfortunately. And it creates quite a mess in the front yard. They break off the branches of the trees and the acorns and the leaves are constantly falling. They build nests in the front yard.

Interviewer: What other kind of animals have you seen in your front yard over the years?

Helen: We are getting infestation because of the shedding of worms and whatnot in the grass that are killing the grass, sod warms, the squirrels digging and nesting and planting acorns in the yard creating holes in the grass as well.

Interviewer: How do you typically interact with your front yard? Are you the one who takes care of it?

Helen: We have a yard service that takes care of the grass. I'd like to maintain the flowers and the bushes myself just as a leisure activity, trimming, replanting, the maintenance of the yard because of the temperature in Houston continuously changes, we have to mulch the yard a lot in the front to protect the root system so that the plants don't die over the frosts that we've been getting lately in the winter.

Interviewer: When it comes to seasons what type of plants or adjustments do you make to help your land with the weather changes?

Helen: Mainly in the floral area, we have annual sections built into our landscaping and have to change that out several times a year depending on whether there is winter frost or not.

Interviewer: Great, thank you so much for helping me out today.

Helen: Thank you very much.

Male: There you go.
