Interviewer: Thank you so much for joining me. What area have you seen the most change in and that you wanna talk about today?

Interviewee: There's an area in Denver that used to be the Stapleton International Airport, which closed in 1995. At the time it was a fully operable international airport, and today it is a residential area completely.

Interviewer: And did you see that change happen pretty rapidly after the airport closed in '95, or has there been consistent changes throughout the last 20 years?

Interviewee: The change was initially quite rapid. The redevelopment started almost immediately after the airport closed and took probably seven or eight years to really take hold. It has continued to change up until now. It's now quite highly populated, a very well planned urban area including different kinds of housing, parks, schools, recreation areas, etc.

Interviewer: What did it look like initially when it was that international airport? Was it kind of, of size of other international airports that we know, or was it different in some way, or did it look a lot like what DIA does now?

Interviewee: It looked a lot like what you would see oh maybe LaGuardia, or other airports in major metropolitan areas that have grown with the city, rather than being picked up and put in a new place outside the city. So there were parts of it that weren't very well thought out that looked like they were tacked on because, in fact, they were. But it was very functional. It was huge. Obviously, enormous runways and terminal areas, and then parking, all of which operated right up until it closed, which I believe was in March of 1995. So it closed down one day, Denver International Airport opened the next day, and Stapleton was never again used for airplanes.

Interviewer: How long did it take for them to deconstruct the old airport? You said it changed pretty quickly. But was it barren for a while, but there are no buildings that remain from the original airport?

Interviewee: They started tearing down the buildings almost immediately. But then, of course, there were miles of asphalt and cement that had to be torn up and that took longer. So the actual teardown process making it available for redevelopment, I would bet, was two or three years.

Interviewer: And what are some of the things you can do here now? Obviously, 20 years ago, you could have a flight there to most of the U.S. and beyond. But what can you do there now? You said it's a residential area. Are there other things there that you can do? 

Interviewee: Yes. It really is sort of a planned, urban development in the sense that there are shopping centers, there are theaters, there are playgrounds, schools, churches. And then multiunit housing, lower income housing, all the way up to extremely nice houses. There are areas where people can let their dogs play, areas where there are parks with playgrounds, and it sort of includes everything.

So I suppose it went from being a place that people came into and left. In other words, it's never a destination itself, just a means to an end, to a place where people spend significant portions of their lives when they lived there. And it also, in my mind, lines up with and it's associated with the growth of Denver because, of course, over the last 20 plus years, Denver has grown enormously. And the Stapleton development area kind of represents that for me because it didn't exist before. And now it is thriving and very heavily populated.

Interviewer: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for your time.

Interviewee: Thank you.
