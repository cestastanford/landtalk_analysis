Interviewer: Okay. So, first, can you please tell me about what you do and where you live. 

Interviewee: Sure. We're a Stanford family and My husband is a Stanford faculty. I myself am a consultant. We live on Stanford campus in the residential area and I have been living here over 20 years.

Interviewer: Great. Next, can you please tell me about how long you've been going to the Stanford Dish for and just kind of describe the ways in which you've seen it change over that time period?

Interviewee: I have been going to the Stanford Dish for recreational hiking over the last 20 years. The ways I've seen it change. I've seen it change in a few ways. First of all, I've seen, I guess Stanford do some work around making the tracks more paved and visible. It used to be that people took their hikes anywhere they wanted, but I think the way that it's organized now is there's paved roads where people go on, so you can't cut in different ways that might have been disturbing to the animals and the wildlife over there. So that's one very obvious thing that I've seen change over the years. The other thing that I've seen change is I've seen various species of animals show up that haven't been there before. I definitely see more wildlife coming closer to people, which is something that has been pointed out as a result of the drought and lack of food. Animals are moving closer, lower down the dish, so you can see them very close to Junipero Serra. Coyotes, I see wild turkey, which is a completely new species of animal that we haven't seen before. We see a lot of them. I would say the last two years they started showing up. They're very aggressive actually. They chase people. They don't like it when you wear red. So it's a pretty interesting phenomenon that I've seen recently.

Interviewer: And how do you think you've seen the plant life change if at all?

Interviewee: So there were a few fires. There was particularly a big one, I think about 10 years ago, that took kind of one side of the dish completely at that point. So there's a lot of new planting to replenish that. I see much more maintenance by Stanford, preventive maintenance, so they would come in at the beginning of the summer when the grass is really tall and dry and they would cut it down, mow it down, to prevent fires. So I see much more of that and a lot of new planting as I mentioned. And other than that it's pretty much the same plants. So I haven't seen much change in the variety of plants, but I see a lot of new animals, that's for sure.

Interviewer: Okay. So you've mentioned, kind of, some of the causes for that change like land development projects, the droughts, and the fires. Do you think that you've seen more change in recent years than in the past 20 years or do you think that the landscape has changed pretty consistently over time?

Interviewee: I would say I think the last 10 years I've seen more changes I think since the fires and then the dry years after that. I've seen more changes in more animals and also in the pace of maintenance, which, you know, that's discretionary for Stanford who's maintaining it, but still it's visible. It closes down for like a few weeks every year for maintenance and... that preventive maintenance to prevent fires and to preserve the wildlife. 

Interviewer: And the last question is, are there any changes in Dish's landscape that you would like to see in future years? 

Interviewee: Well, I wish they should allow dogs in there, although I can understand why they don't allow dogs. That's the one change I would like to see. Other than that, I would like to see maybe more trees planted around the peak area because during the summer months, it gets pretty hot and there's no shade there. So that's the one change. I don't know if it's feasible, but that's the one change I would like to see.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you so much for your time today. 

Interviewee: You're welcome.
