Interviewer: Okay. Hello. Do you wanna just say your name and then just tell me, like, is it okay if I just record you for the sake of this ecology project?

Prof. McKeown: Sure. It's fine to record me. I am Professor Nick McKeown here at Stanford in computer science and electrical engineering. 

Interviewer: Awesome. So I'm just going to ask you a series of questions just about like somewhere that you've lived for a certain amount of time and then just track how you feel like it has changed throughout the years. 

Prof. McKeown: Uh-huh.

Interviewer: Okay. So, what's like somewhere that you have lived for a long time? Yeah, let's start off with that. 

Prof. McKeown: Yeah. So I lived in the U.K. in England from, so I'm 55 and I lived in the U.K. from 1963 until 1989, and then when I was 26, I moved to the U.S. to do a PhD at Berkeley, and then I've lived in the Bay Area ever since.

Interviewer: So let's focus on the Bay Area, because I think that's when, as a child, it's a little bit hard to like recall like with super clear memory.

Prof. McKeown: Sure. Uh-huh.

Interviewer: How was the Bay Area when you first moved in, whether it'd be from like an ecological perspective or just like a technological perspective? I'm sure it wasn't like a Silicon Valley-ee as now. 

Prof. McKeown: Yeah. So, at the time, Silicon Valley was very much a presence, and people would talk about, obviously, Silicon Valley and the Bay Area being the technology hub of the United States. But there were a lot fewer people, there was a lot less tech, there's been a lot more buildings since then. The roads have got a lot busier. And, at that time, it was much more in keeping with the original Silicon Valley, and there was still a lot of emphasis on hardware, semiconductor industry. And so companies like Hewlett Packard were still very dominant at that time. And at that time the most common products that they built was test equipment and things that were hardware. They were very big in semiconductor manufacturer, and designing the tools and the fabrication facilities. So, there was much more emphasis on hardware. 

Nowadays that's much more on software. And so, the name Silicon Valley seems a bit odd these days. It's really all about software. If we think of companies like Google and Facebook and things like that. There's a lot more people. And so, Silicon Valley is certainly in the Bay Area is much, much more crowded. One part of Silicon Valley that has changed perhaps more than anything else is San Francisco. In that San Francisco was very much not part of Silicon Valley. It was very much not part of the tech industry. There was very little high tech, and startups, and people involved in software and tech in general. Obviously, that's changed a lot. Mostly in the last 10 years, as there's been an influx of young people who are involved in the tech industry and making it no longer possible for many people who had lived here perhaps as California natives, San Francisco natives, they could no longer afford to live in San Francisco anymore, creating all the sort of the political tension that's been going on around rent and real estate prices. 

Interviewer: How do you think that, ecologically, San Francisco has changed? Because there's been a huge population boom, but not necessarily more housing being built, just because of like zoning laws and stuff. And also, you would expect there to be like a huge increase in pollution, but at the same time, because of the culture surrounding Silicon Valley and whatnot, it feels like there's more green ways of travel now such as like the electric scooters becoming like really, really popular in San Francisco, do you think that's...

Prof. McKeown: You know, it's always been the case that the public transport in the Bay Area was pretty abysmal compared to most of the rest of the world. And I don't know the numbers, but my guess is that the relatively small fraction of the travel that takes place in the Bay Area is actually on public transport. I think the majority of it is still with motor vehicles. There were no electric cars when I first moved here, and so that obviously changed a significant amount. My guess, though, is that that's more than offset by the increase in population. While I don't know it to be true, I would guess that there's a lot more pollution and a lot lower air quality today than there was, merely just because of the number of people. I would imagine the amount of pollution per person has really gone down. 

There was, you know, a little bit of recycling. I was a grad student in Berkeley from 1989 to 1995, but I was also a homeowner, and so I was, now thinking about it, there was a pittance of recycling and that really took off, I feel, in the sort of the mid-1990s. It became very common. A lot of attention was placed on recycling. At that time, recycling was almost entirely done through separation into different types of recycling component, you know, glass, metal, paper, etc. And now, you know, as far as I'm aware, most residential recycling is done, it's all combined and then it's separated, hopefully, at a recycling center instead. And so, my understanding is that there's a higher fraction of trash that is actually recyclable material. 

Yeah. So, the other ways in which it seems most present. I would say that it was much more common for people to have wood fires, and that may be, you know, because I lived in Berkeley and now I live around near Stanford, that was possibly more common. But I've noticed, in visiting Berkeley in recent years, much less common to smell the smoke of burning wood, and I imagine that's largely to do with air quality, or that it's now not allowed in significant portions of the Bay Area. The amount of trash that you would see in the Bay, and the sort of the smelliness of the Bay presumably coming from pollution, I would say has gone down. That would be my sort of anecdotal perception, particularly in crossing the side of the Dumbarton Bridge, where it was very evident before there was significant amounts of plastic trash, and I don't see anything like that around anymore. 

Interviewer: Do you feel like that, obviously it's like a city, so San Francisco didn't necessarily have like the greatest amount of like biodiversity, or a lot of like trees in general, even I imagine like 20 30 years ago, do you think that there's been a noticeable change in like the amount of plant life in the Bay Area, like decreasing or increasing?

Prof. McKeown: I think, without doubt, San Francisco is less green than it was. There's been a huge increase in the number of high-rise buildings. And you only have to look at pictures of the skyline from 10 years ago to now to see the, particularly in the area where the new railway hub is being built, there's a massive increase in the number of high-rise around the Bay Bridge area. And so, you know, that has largely come at the cost of tree-lined streets. And so, while there were no forests or parks that were destroyed, there's certainly a lot less greenery in that part of the city. You know, if I'm looking down on the city from a sort of vantage point today, it looks a lot less green to me than it did then. 

For the rest of the Bay Area. Well, there's been a lot of filling in. I can remember when they were significant gaps in housing when you drive from, say, Palo Alto to San Francisco and 101. That's no longer the case. It's pretty much continual development all the way. Everything has merged into one at this point. However, what's quite remarkable is the whole corridor of 280, which has stayed under pretty strict preservation and conservation, I presume, because of the Open Space Trusts that are along the watershed area to the west of 280. It seems real estate very, very low in development and that's quite remarkable. I mean, if you think about it, that whole corridor of green to the west of 280 that we see if we go from here to San Francisco, almost without any buildup of housing or development at all, quite remarkable foresight of a group of people who battled to try and preserve and conserve that space and put it into Open Space Trusts. That's pretty remarkable. I think that, given how close it is to not only Silicon Valley, but very, very high real estate cost areas, it's quite amazing that that stayed intact.

Interviewer: Awesome. Cool. I think that's it for all the questions I have. Thank you so much. 

Prof. McKeown: You're welcome.
