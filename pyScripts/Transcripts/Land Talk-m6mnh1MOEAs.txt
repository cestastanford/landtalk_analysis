Interviewee: So when I first came into Newton, the place was filled with a mixture of some larger houses but many, many smaller houses. In some areas, the houses were very, very dramatic and large, but in other areas, there were tiny little houses that were built for veterans and were really fitted around family and community. And those areas are no longer there. 

Interviewer: So you're saying that a lot of the houses have just become bigger and now they're more estate-style [SP] rather than these, like, small family-oriented homes? 

Interviewee: That is generally how many of those have turned, and even some of the bigger houses have been knocked down to replace them with even bigger houses. So whilst there was smaller shopping areas and smaller houses, many of them have been replaced with bigger shopping areas and even bigger houses. And in fact, because the school system is good, they've also increased the number of huge buildings to allow more people into the area. 

Interviewer: Huge buildings, what do you mean by that? 

Interviewee: Apartment blocks with lots and lots of apartments so that more people can access the better school systems, and so that where they were once industrial areas, they are now littered between industrial areas, and then also putting in big apartment complexes to allow more people access to the school systems. 

Interviewer: And what about, like, the nature aspects of it? Has the nature changed at all? 

Interviewee: Not as much as you would expect the nature to change because it is an area that really values parks and values trees. So there are parts where they've pulled up old trees to build bigger houses, but the parks remain where they were. So there are still beautiful, green areas but some of the older trees and the older, established nature has been destroyed in certain areas to put the bigger houses in, but not as much as you would expect. 

Interviewer: Okay. And so, in terms of...now switching more towards activities, like, some of the activities you used to do versus...you talk about the activities you used to do 20 years ago versus the activities you do now, both in general and also within the context of nature. But really, whatever you think best answers the question. 

Interviewee: So I think it also depends on where you are in your life. Some of the activities we did were pre-children. So when you are pre-children, we would go into downtown Boston much more often as opposed to stay in the suburbs. And we would also walk around within the Boston area and do more things, going out late at night. When we had children and also when we moved out into the suburbs more, we spent more time out in the suburbs. 

We have gone on hikes but not anywhere near Boston, but rather more out further west of Boston, where we've climbed up mountains or gone skiing in certain areas. But the difference really is the amount of going into Boston versus interacting with nature, which we did more when the kids were born and we could be more in the suburbs. In downtown Boston, whilst there are beautiful park areas that we did go to, the actual downtown Boston where the stores are and where some of the activities are, we don't do as often. 

Interviewer: Okay. Yeah, anything else that comes to mind that you want to talk about in terms of how the area has changed and how you interact with the area. 

Interviewee: The other thing I think that's different for us is that there's a whole, not so advanced train system called the T, and I think before, probably 20 years ago, we used the actual T more, which was public transport and much of it is above ground. So it's not a high, like a high-speed rail but more kind of, like, a trolley system, not quite. But not like a San Francisco trolley system but trains that are above ground.

And I feel like that whole, using the public transport system has really shifted now that we use cars more and I don't go on the public transportation as much. So I feel like the interaction with downtown Boston has shifted a lot. Whereas where I might have used more of the infrastructure in that way, now I think we use less of the public infrastructure and more individual cars and individual, you know, in small groups of going out, which I think, one, impacts the environment for sure, but also, it means you don't interact with as many people. [inaudible 00:04:57].

Interviewer: Do you think that's a by-product of the fact that, you know, your preferences have changed, or do you think that's more of a general shift of people that you observe in the Boston and Newton area? 

Interviewee: I think my preferences have changed in some part. I think it's more efficient to have your own car. You can come and go as you please, you're not reliant on a hot, squishy subway system. So I think it's more about when you're younger, you do things that you wouldn't necessarily do when you're older. 

And also, when I work downtown, I use the public transportation system. But when you work out in suburbs, as I do now, you really don't access it that much and it's not as convenient, so I end up using my car more. So I think it's just sort of a mixture of, one, I don't work downtown and, secondly, it's just more convenient to have your own car.
