Woman: The call is now being recorded.

Jessica: Hello.

Interviewer: Hi. Jess.

Jessica: Hello.

Interviewer: Jess?

Jessica: Yes.

Interviewer: Do you hear me.

Jessica: Yes.

Interviewer: Okay, can you state your name and that you consent to being recorded.

Jessica: Jessica Menza, [SP] and yes, I consent to being recorded.

Interviewer: Okay, Jessica, tell us where you're from.

Jessica: I'm from Folsom California a small suburban neighborhood right outside of Sacramento California.

Interviewer: And what was it like growing up in Folsom as a kid so can you speak about the kind of activities you did and such?

Jessica: Yes, so growing up as a kid we did a lot of both indoor and outdoor activities but as far as outdoor activities. Sacramento area is very hot during the summer it reaches over 100 degrees so most of the activities we are doing involve the water so that we could cool down. Our family had a boat and there was a lake there so a lot of our activities involved going boating to being if we were at home we had a pool we would do water balloon fights. We would even just spray each other with the hose if we're on the trampoline and having fun. So most of those activities just revolved around water because it was so hot so if you were outside it was pretty much the only way you could bear being outside.

Interviewer: Okay, and how long was your boating season at the time?

Jessica: At the time our boating season was roughly around April to August so it was really long.

Interviewer: Wow, okay, and did you ever think about water conservation as a kid?

Jessica: Not as a kid there wasn't really a reason to think about it first of all, one I was young and then also there wasn't a problem with not having enough water. So there was never a time my dad was like, "Oh, no we can't do water balloon fights today, or we can't do this." So there wasn't really a worry at all.

Interviewer: There just wasn't a conversation at the time about it? 

Jessica: Correct, yes, there was no conversation so it wasn't something that I was worried about.

Interviewer: And then when and how did you start noticing climate change in your town?

Jessica: In my town, I started noticing climate change about let's see here, so it's my junior year of high school and this was probably around 2011, around that time. That's kinda when it started going downhill so up until that point, great boating season, using water all the time and then it started to decline. So the first thing I personally noticed was going boating and in order to get to our boat we have to walk downstairs and that's where the boat is. But during a good boating season it's probably only at the max five seconds, it takes about two seconds to get from the parking lot to where your boat is. The next thing...

Interviewer: And then the rest of the stairs are underwater?

Jessica: Correct yes, so the rest of the stairs are under water so then if we are getting less rain and there is climate problems then there are those stairs to be...so that's what started to happen. So then it started to become 20 stairs 40 stairs so we were walking down about 20 minutes to get to the boat. And when we're going boating you're having all your coolers so it was noticeable for me because you're carrying all this heavy stuff for 20 minutes to get down to the boat. So that's the first time in high school when I was like, "Okay, there's something going on here, there's a problem." And then also the boating season went from many months to maybe two months if we were lucky.

Interviewer: And that's because the water was so low?

Jessica: Correct, so that you weren't allowed to put your boat in until the water level reaches its store in capacity. And it took longer to reach that and then it went away a lot faster so that's why it was shorter.

Interviewer: And then so once that became the situation how did that affect the kinds of activities you did and your overall experience at home?

Jessica: So besides activities, we started doing more things that were inside because there became more of a worry for water. So we couldn't be outside trying to hose at each other and having fun because that was seen as you know, not caring for the environment or wasting water. We were kind of a state where there are a lot of restrictions on us, so even if we wanted to do that we couldn't. We had to...we couldn't use the water as much as we wanted to so we started doing things inside more or just being outside and not using as much water, doing things like playing sports and stuff like that. And then do you want me to speak about kind of how it changed in the town as well? 

Interviewer: Yes, that would be great.

Jessica: Okay, so then it started, so we would before you could wash your cars all the time we kind of saw that as a fun activity because you could spray each other and it was fun. But then we started to have to do car washes and less because you weren't allowed to wash your car in your driveway anymore because you used a lot more water than you would if you went to a standard car wash. So we weren't allowed to do that anymore. Signs started to go about restaurants where they were only serving water to you upon request. Whereas before you would have your water given to you right away, and anytime your water was even if it was halfway full they started tipping it off. So you started to have to kind of way down the waiter if you wanted more water as well.

Interviewer: Wow.

Jessica: And then all also another one was you had schedule days where you were allowed to water your lawn. And because before people are watering their lawn probably every day but then you're only allowed to do either the odd days of the week or verses that even days. So lawns kind of started to turn more brown and because of this people, this is a little bit later on when it was worse. But people started to change into their lawns into either just being bark or they would buy the turf so that they weren't having to water their lawns and then also have brought lawns even with watering them.

Interviewer: Well, so everybody kind of just made the effort to use a bunch less water.

Jessica: Yes. So well, so citywide and a lot that was because of regulations that were placed on the city with how much water you were allowed to use. But it also was you know, you could see people's personal efforts of trying to make a change with that as well.

Interviewer: And so has this led you to interact with your hometown and other places around the world any differently?

Jessica: Yeah, I think being able to see the change of how big of a difference it was from going. Oh, no the lake change was like I can't even begin to describe how astonishing it was and how much of a difference was. Because a lot of people you know, you hear this term of climate change and you know, they haven't really seen it, they don't know what that means what it looks like in their life because they haven't seen that drastic change of water levels. So I was able to see that personally so now just the simple stuff you know, being aware of how much water I'm using the water. The water that putting in more laundry in within one load so you don't have to split it up or making sure that your dishwasher is actually full when you run it, decreasing the time you shower. So just being more aware of how much water you're using on a daily basis and every time you can I just try to take a chance to reduce the amount of water I'm using.

Interviewer: Wow, that's great. Well, thank you, for answering all these questions. I think I have enough to do my assignment.

Jessica: Okay, awesome I'm glad I could help.

Interviewer: Okay. Thanks, Jess.

Jessica: Okay, bye.
