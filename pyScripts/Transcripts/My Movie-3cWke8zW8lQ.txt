Andrew: Hello, everyone. This is my Land Talk interview. This is my mom and we're going to be talking about the Children's Pool in San Diego, which is a beach cove-like area in La Jolla where I'm from. So first things first, if you wouldn't mind describing a little bit about what it was like 20 years ago and how it's changed.

Interviewee: Okay, so I moved here from Menlo Park in 1989. And the Children's Pool was a protected area that Ellen Browning Scripps had built a seawall for the children of San Diego to learn to swim. It was basically a protected Pacific Ocean area. But over the last at least 15 to 20 years it's become an area for the seals because they're protected under the...excuse me...Marine Protection Act. And so seals have adopted it, and they move in, and they pup on the ocean area. And it's become quite controversial in San Diego because some of the older, traditional ideas are that, "Oh, we should preserve this for kids," not really recognizing that now we have the "Y" and home swimming pools. And others think that we have miles and miles and miles and miles of ocean beach and that this is an area the seals could, you know, actually have. It's quite controversial in La Jolla.

Andrew: So as far as how the land itself has changed, with the seals now there, have you noticed any difference, maybe, in the water quality or in how much sand there is?

Interviewee: Oh, yeah. The area isn't in continuity, particularly with the ocean. It's protected, so it doesn't wash out very well. And so it's quite polluted with seal feces, and it's not a place I'd want my kids to swim anymore and most people don't really want to swim there. Also because it's protected, what has happened is that the sand is collected on the beach and it's much less a pool now and much more a shallow...more like an inlet with a large beach.

Andrew: Can you speak to maybe how the urbanization around the area and how, you know, the increase in tourism or whatnot has affected the seals?

Interviewee: It's a very popular tourist area because people who aren't from California rarely have the opportunity to get so close or see seals up in their natural environment. It's really a problem, we have to have a ranger there all the time because so many of them want to take selfies, they want to harass the seals, and they don't recognize that these are wild animals who weigh like, you know, 800 and 1000 pounds

Andrew: All right. Well, thank you so much for giving me some of your valuable time to talk about this. Really appreciate it and hope you have a good night.

Interviewee: Anytime, Andrew. Good night.

Andrew: Bye.
