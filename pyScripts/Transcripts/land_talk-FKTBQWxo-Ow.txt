Interviewer: Okay, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about a place that you've known for at least 20 years and for being able to participate in this land talk for my class.

Okay, so I see that the location that we are already talking about today is Jordan Commons in Sandy, Utah. So can you tell me about how long you have been familiar with this place?

Interviewee: I was at high school, Jordan High School, and my mother and dad actually worked there. It was 1914, and then it was redone again. And I attended and graduated from Jordan High in 1961. And then, about 1999 they tore it down and built the newly-built Jordan Commons Restaurant and Entertainment Complex in Sandy. And it had 17 screens, TV theater screens. And it's a wonderful location and it has grown to be one of the highest grossing theaters locally as well as ranking among the top theaters nationwide. They've expanded many times but I go there at least once a month...its wonderful theaters. And we used to do a lot of things at the high school. As you can see how it did change. They did keep that centerpiece as you walked in, the entrance with the stairs, they kept, that is, at the Jordan Commons and so that you can see the high school was there.

Interviewer: Right, so they've kept the same entryway?

Interviewee: Same entryway, but the stairs go up.

Interviewer: Awesome. So can you tell me a bit about, I know we've talked about this a little bit, but what it used to look like I guess in a bit more detail? I saw some of the photos, but so we can talk about this on the recording as well.

Interviewee: Well, the straight building there along State Street didn't look a lot different. You can see all the pictures, all of the windows. And then when they changed it, it's solid and you've got the lighter-colored pieces there except for the stairs that go up. So it was a good, big high school but it was all long and it didn't look a lot different then. But then the state made the changes. The building is conducive to all the activities that are going on there. I took pictures of all around the sides of it and now there's a lot of things going on, big parking garages and other things.

Interviewer: Nice. Can you tell me about some of the activities they used to do there back when you were in high school?

Interviewee: When I was in high school, yeah, we had football games. We had basketball games, a lot of different things like that going on at the actual high school. East of that building was the track and the area where we did all of those things. Just went to school and just learned and did that kind of stuff.

Interviewer: I can imagine. Very cool. And so can you tell me about some of the changes that you've seen over time in this location?

Interviewee: Yeah, they've added to it and a lot of the restaurant and entertainment areas there, they've changed. Over the years there used to be a Mayan restaurant and they had...it was a huge thing on the end there and it lasted for several years and it was really fun. And they had high diving coming down off of these fountains and rocks and everything inside. And it was a big drop. It went out of business and changed to something else. Now, there's a whole bunch of other things in there. So, over the years, there's been some changes but it is still a real good location.

Interviewer: Very good. Okay, and then you mentioned that you go there at least once per month. Can you tell me about some of the activities that you do there I assume you still do?

Interviewee: Yeah, I just go to movies or to the restaurants. I'm a real movie buff, so I enjoy going over there. Now, they've changed inside, now that the movies...like everywhere else they've changed them too. You have the recliner chairs and you have some fancy stuff going on. They serve food in there if you're in those special units where the recliner chairs are, they'll bring you food and a warm blanket and that kind of stuff.

Interviewer: Very luxurious.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Nice. Okay, and then is there anything else that you'd like to tell me about this location while I still have you?

Interviewee: I can't think so, it's just...I don't think so. It's a real landmark for our area and Sandy, and it's a big city now and so it's considered something pretty special.

Interviewer: Awesome. Well, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

Interviewee: You bet I've enjoyed it.
