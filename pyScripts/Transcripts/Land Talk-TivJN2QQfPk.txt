Carl: Hello, this is Carl Bertucci. It's January 26. I'm doing my Land Talk interview with my dad, who's going to be talking about Newport Coast in Southern California. So the first question I have is, how did the observer describe the place used to look. So what did Newport Coast looked like before it looked like how it is right now.

Interviewee: Well, I moved here to Orange County to Newport Beach in 1990. I used to live up in Los Angeles in Hermosa Beach and moved down here to Corona Mall which is the southernmost part of Newport Beach. And I used to do a lot of cycling, a lot of road cycling. And there was literally nothing in this whole area that's now called Newport Coast, which is rolling hills and really not even any of roads or anything. There was no retail areas, no nothing. And so we would cycle up and down Pacific Coast Highway and ultimately, they put one road in from PCH over down into another area into Irvine. And we would cycle up and down that hill and one day we saw these signs that they were going to build some residential area here. And candidly, we were actually a little hacked off about it. We thought our pristine area which was just these rolling hills, great hiking trails, pristine beaches was going to become some residential area.

Carl: So can you tell me a little bit about how the place has changed from the rolling hills to the hustle and bustle of Newport Coast now.

Interviewee: Well, hustle and bustle is all a relative term, right? But I went from the hacked off guy who rode his bike all up and down these hills to a guy who bought a house and raised his family here in Newport Coast in one of those homes they built because they did it really, really well. But, you know, the reality is, there were two very large, very significant retail developments that were done. There were two 18 hole championship golf courses built. There was a very large, very significant resort built here, Pelican Hill resort, Crystal Cove, Newport Coast. I mean, literally thousands and thousands of homes. And, you know, it's just a very different place. You know, it was open space. It was hiking trails and walking and biking, and now it's just part of, you know, better or worse, suburbia.

Carl: So what are some of the things besides biking and hiking that you used to do there?
 
Interviewee: Well, there's an entire...and we're literally talking about miles, a number of miles. It's less than 10 and more than 2. I'd say, you know, probably five miles of this literally pristine coast land that very private, was very unused, was, you know, kind of felt like our own private beach. And now because of all the residents it's not private and there's lots of people who use it, and you can tell. You know, there are tide pools, and sea anemones, and starfish that we would see like, all the time there, and now I think that, you know, the impact of having a lot of humans utilizing this stuff and these resources, these natural resources for 20 years has had a negative impact. You know, while the state park system does a great job at Reef Point and in some of those places, you can see the human footprint or the fingerprint on it. And there's definitely, you know, there's more trash and things like that. So it's just, you know, it's incremental and, you know, look, we've loved living here but the human growth, the human sprawl into this area has definitely had an interesting and probably somewhat negative impact on what used to be pretty darn pristine and beautiful. In a natural sense, right? I mean, look, you know, as anyone you grew up here, right? It's a great area, it's beautiful. The development was done by the Irvine Company and it's been lauded as one of the best master plan communities anywhere in the nation. So, you know, we're blessed that way. But it's definitely very, very different than it was 25 plus years ago.

Carl: So you mentioned...well, obviously you live there, you work there. So that's about all you do there now. What about some recreational activities that you partake in?

Interviewee: Currently or then or both?

Carl: Right now.That you do now. 

Interviewee: Right now. So I run here. I love running on the beach and occasionally I'll surf down at that beach down at Reef Point I told you about. 
 
Carl: Wow. Very interesting. I think that concludes our interview. I would like to thank you for taking the time out of your night to answer some awesome questions about past and present Newport Beach.

Interviewee: You're very welcome. Anytime.
