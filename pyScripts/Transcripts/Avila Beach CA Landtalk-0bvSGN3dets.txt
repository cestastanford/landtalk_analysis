Interviewer: All right. I'm here with Patrick Bolger from San Luis Obispo, California. He's going to talk a little bit about Avila Beach, which is very, very close to San Luis Obispo. So, Patrick, I know you grew up around the area. How would you say that Avila Beach used to you still look when you were a kid?

Patrick: All right. Avila Beach was kind of a small town, kind of a biker bar-type trailer town, pretty rough around the edges. There was probably a population of 1,000 or less. Most of the people who walked around there were like either barefoot or in flip-flops. There is some large oil tanks on the hills. I think Unocal or Chevron had those. And it was I think large tankers would come in and offload their oil or I guess it was oil from the pier. And then there's kind of only one hotel in town and basically only one grocery store, kind of a small little grocery store. So, that's kind of what it looked like, I guess.

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, kind of comparing that in time between you growing up and now, how would you say the town has changed, not just only with respect to the, like, atmosphere around there, but also the environmental and ecological factors?

Patrick: Well, it's definitely grown in population. I would guess the population is now probably around 10,000 people. It's become more affluent and gentrified generally. The developers after they did the cleanup of the oil plume beneath the sand, developers came in and they've really capitalized on the beachfront location. There's probably four hotels now. There's more shops and vendors, and they've kind of made it a bigger, like a waterfront recreational area. They've closed the main Front Street, so it's walking only or pedestrian only. No cars. And then the sand, I think they had to truck in a lot of sand from outside the area. So, the sand doesn't feel as fine and it's not as white as it used to be. I don't know for whatever reason. Maybe the San Luis Crete doesn't flush out as much as it used to. But it's definitely more...there's more aggregate sand than there used to be.

Interviewer: Wow. Interesting. So, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but how would you think that those changes in things like the sand and just the overall, I don't know, more influx of people, how would that have affected your sort of activities around the area and your beach going pleasures?

Patrick: Well, I think nowadays you have to kind of get there earlier because the population swells during the weekends from out-of-towners, mostly from Fresno and Bakersfield. We used to fish off the pier and they used to have like small...they had a large swing and large slide. And now that they've built up the waterfront, you know, there's a big play area that, you know, we've introduced our kids to. And basically, it became, I don't know, a recreational area for about two or three hours for our kids. And we'd still go out in the water and everything and we'd barbecue. But, I'm not sure what [inaudible 00:05:00].

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sounds a little bit about like the fishing of it. Have you noticed like when you were younger, did there used to be like a large commercial fishing like area around there and has it, like, changed at all in that time?

Patrick: Yeah, the fishing area, like Port San Luis, was probably...there was more fishing boats and stuff in the water in Port San Luis than there are today. I think just with some of the fishing moratorium and cutting back on some species, a lot of the die-hard fishermen have left the area. I think most of them have continued to move north towards Monterey and even farther north than that. It was a fishing village and that's probably contributed to it's kind of a rough atmosphere in the 70s and the early 80s. But now you don't see as many people fishing just off the pier. But you just don't see as many of fishing boats and trawlers in the harbor anymore.

Interviewer: That's pretty interesting. All right. Well, thank you for your time. I think that about wraps it up, but yeah. Thanks.

Patrick: All right. You're welcome. Yeah.
