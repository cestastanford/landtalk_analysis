Interviewer: Okay, Father Zadock, can you tell us what location you've been around for a long time?

Father Zadock: Well, the town which had sort of the most impact was Orinda, California, just on the other side of the Oakland Hills through the Caldecott Tunnel. And I have seen a world of change. We first moved out there in 1948 and even as a very, very small child, I'm talking four or five years of age, we called it the Crossroads. Now there's a major freeway, there's BART, and it is simply suburbia plus. But in those days, when we said, "The Crossroads," we meant the crossroads. It was simply the road from the tunnel to Walnut Creek and from Orinda village to Moraga. And there was a stop right there.

So a whole incredible network of freeways and BART tracks, that's all brand new. The hills in those days were largely just simply rolling hills, beautiful rolling hills with lots of oak. Orinda was a very small town, had two very noticeable features, the Orinda Theater, which is still there, still operating and the Casa de Orinda, which was kind of a steakhouse and bar. Its real claim to fame was it was the site of legal gambling. Cards were going on there at night and so that brought in people from all around the area. And of course, the theater brought people in from Saint Mary's College, Lafayette, and then the surrounding areas.

In those times, the backyard was simply rolling hills. I mean where I lived...it was just one mile from the center of town. We had just incredible land, open land behind us. We had a lot of land which was the water company. And so where we could have simply marched anywhere, tree houses everywhere, forts everywhere. It was a kids' play land, it was certainly absolutely delightful. Now it is simply wall to wall, suburbia, houses upon houses, those open spaces are all gone. Yes, the trees are still there but nestled between all those trees are very expensive homes.

The town was therefore very safe and open. In that period of time you never thought to lock the door of your house. I mean, why would you do that? You trusted your neighbors. And in cities at that time, really Orinda at that time, you trusted your neighbor to be a kind of observer of your children and vice versa. So there was a kind of free-flowing, you know, back and forth. That is totally gone. Right now in Orinda, the people who know their neighbors are very far and few between, where I could list all the names of all the people on a half mile of a terra road. I'll make you a bet people are lucky to know simply the neighbor on the right and their left and across the street.

So sociologically, it's a different, totally different kind of reality. In the early days, you could get an acre for 108 bucks in some areas. Now we're talking big figures, extremely high figures, all six figures. The school system was decent and very good and very safe even back then, so in that sense that aspect of the town is still positive on...going forward. They certainly maintained the quality of their schools.

Interviewer: Did you notice any like, specific environmental changes like in terms of animals or plants or anything in the hills?

Father Zadock: Yes, in terms of animals, you certainly saw and you still see, but then even more like for example, deer. Deer were all over the place. Quail were all over the place.  We used to even hunt quail, not with a gun. Even then shooting in your backyard was not a safe thing to do, but you could certainly trap them. But you don't see that as often, the population is much, much smaller. In terms of what was predominantly just oak and rolling grass hills, of course, people brought all their favorite trees, all the, you know, flaming maples, magnolias, jacaranda, I mean. So now it's kind of a cornucopia of all different kinds of plants and trees. 

It was much simpler back then. Then people tended to having, you know, lawn, kind of your basic kind of camellias and some roses, maybe some juniper berries, that kind of stuff. But that was about it. So how people decorated was very, very, very different also and much simpler. 

Interviewer: Are there any activities that you still like to do in the winter or that your friends like to do there in the hills?

Father Zadock: You know, it's become a very different kind of thing because see when I'm reflecting, I'm not doing it as a kid, okay? Then, of course, all the activities shifted to the schools. Okay, that's well and good fun, there's your games or sports. But what people used to do together...I think that that's kind of shifted. One very popular activity in those days, for example, was going to the city. And the city meant only one thing, you're going to San Francisco. Now we think of Orinda, Walnut Creek, Lafayette, that concrete area, you can get some of the most marvelous restaurants in the world.

In those days you only thought, "The city." You went to San Francisco for major celebrations, festivals, parties. It was the place to go. It was the kind of the Shangri La across the bay and it had a kind of almost mystical quality to it in terms of eating, what was happening in the city. So the city very much dominated the whole area. Now I think the city really pales, you know? Anything you want, anything you need, you can get it right locally. In those days, you know, you had some major department stores in Walnut Creek, but if you really want to go for the good stuff, you really wanted to go to the concentration, the city, the city. Then you had City of Paris. They had the Magnin stores. Anything of real quality...you went to the city.

Now in those days also, while there was no inner rail transportation at that time, the Sacramento on Northern had just recently folded but up until late '50s, if you were in Oakland you could take the Key System and you went straight across the bridge by train. We had a fabulous inner rail system at that time still. But our love affair with the car took over and since we needed then a second born, the tunnel in those hills and then a third born, and it's still crowded and congested. So if anything, it's also the rifle congestion of the whole area.

One of the things is very apparent in government you know, at that time, people did not want much government. And so the participation government was really, really limited and therefore there was no real city planning. While Orinda is so small that, you know, once the main roads were there, they were pretty well locked down. You went to your neighborhood to let's say, to conquer it and it was a free for all. The lack of planning is very evident right now in that city. But that lack of government, that lack of oversight was characteristic of that whole corridor.

Interviewer: Great. Well, thank you so much, I appreciate it.

Father Zadock: Thank you.
