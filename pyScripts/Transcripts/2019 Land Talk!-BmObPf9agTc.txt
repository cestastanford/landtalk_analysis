Will: Hi, I'm Will Bodenhamer. And this is my 2019 Land Talk. Today I'll be interviewing my father...

Roby: Roby Bodenhamer. 

Will: And so first off we would like to let you all know that we will be talking about...

Roby: Chester. 

Will: Okay. So the first question I have is what do you remember about Chester from when you were a kid? 

Roby: I remember growing up in Chester when it was a really small community and everybody knew everybody and playing sports, going to Moore's Lake. Going to CRA as a teenager and just hanging out with my friends. 

Will: So would you say that everybody knowing everybody is a good thing or a bad thing?

Roby: I think at the time it's...I think it's a very good thing because I think somebody could easily just pick up the phone and call your parents since they already knew you or they knew of you, they could easily track you down. 

Will: Okay. So next we have, what is your favorite part about living here? 

Roby: Kind of as I said it before, I think it's a very small community where everybody does know everybody. And I think that over the years this kind of as it's gotten larger, maybe it lost some sense of community, but there's still a large population that still live in Chester, that grew up in Chester that have lived here for their entire lives and that are now 60, 70, 80-years-old or older. 

Will: Okay. What kind of hobbies have you picked up since you've lived in Chester?

Roby: Playing baseball, playing football, just hanging out with friends and just joy. I've always been proud of being from Chester. 

Will: Okay. What kind of animals have you seen in Chester? 

Roby: I've seen a lot of different animals in Chester. Obviously, the domesticated dogs, cats, I've seen pigs. I've seen snakes. I've seen foxes, coyotes, deer, mice, birds, vultures, eagles on the river. Obviously the fish, fishing. 

Will: Would you say like you ever felt like in danger because of the wildlife? 

Roby: The only wildlife I really would feel in danger from are the deer. And that's more from driving in Chester and striking one with a vehicle. 

Will: Okay. What kind of trees or plants have been in Chester or are still in Chester? 

Roby: I think the majority of the trees are fairly the same.  I think there's a lot more tree growth in Chester where people are more conservationists and planting trees. Obviously, there's a lot of palm trees. I think there's more, a lot of decorative trees as well. On some of the highways, you still have a lot of large oak trees, walnut trees that still exist in old parts of Chester that have been here for 50 to 100 years or more. 

Will: Would you say the state tree, the dogwood is very common? 

Roby: Yeah, it's very common. I know my parents, still live in Chester, my mom and they still have several dogwood trees and my house in Chester,  my first house I lived in Chester had several dogwood trees on the property as well. 

Will: Okay. How would you say the weather or the rainfall has changed over time? 

Roby: I think it seems that maybe the weather would be more severe now, but I think the technology is a lot better now than it was back when I was younger or when I was a kid. So it's more they can predict the weather better. I think by that, I think the thunderstorms, it seems like they are a lot worse now. But as a kid, I don't remember 'em being really bad. They really didn't scare me. Obviously, we've had a lot of rain over the last couple of years. But I think for the most part, for me the weather's fairly the same. It gets hot during the summer. It gets cold during the winter. 

Will: Would you say that the actual temperature itself has really changed much since you've been a kid?

Roby: I don't think it's really changed so much as since I was a kid. I mean, I was outside, outdoors growing up all the way through high school before I went to college. So the weather seems the same to me. 

Will: Have there been any big storms in the last 20 years that you can think of? 

Roby: There have been several big storms actually. We've had Hurricane Isabel and Hurricane Gaston come through in the early 2000s and dumped a lot of rain. The house that I lived in, in Chester at the time, when I believe Gaston came through. I had several huge oak trees fall across the property and do some damage on my property. I remember the power being out for a week or longer. A lot of rain. I remember just having to go to work a lot without the power and obviously having kids, worried about them and take care of them and running the generator the whole time. 

Will: Okay. So you've lived here your whole life, so what do you say you would miss the most from 20 years ago? 

Roby: I think what I missed the most is Chester...Chester is an ever-growing community and it's getting larger and larger. I kind of still missed the sense of that Chester was still smaller, more close-knit community than it is now because there are so many more homes, more apartments within Chester and it's still building and still growing. I think that's probably what I would miss most. I wish it was still kind of the smaller acquaint community, where it wasn't as heavily populated as it is now. 

Will: So on your eyes, the growing of it, if too much is a negative thing. 

Roby: I believe so. Because the roadways haven't really expanded so much in the last 20 years and there's a lot more traffic on the road as well. 

Will: Okay. And what do you like most about Chester now? 

Roby: I think that you know, with the 20-year growth and the population growing, I think there's a lot more job opportunities and I think there's a lot more restaurants and things to do in Chester than it was 20 years ago. A lot more places to shop with the Kohl's, you know, you have the Lowe's, you have Home Depot, you have multiple grocery stores, you have a  Kohl's shopping center and pretty much have every type of restaurant you want to eat at that you could possibly eat at if you wanted to go. And it's only five minutes away. 

Will: Okay. How has the landscape changed over time? 

Roby: I think there's been a lot more new development with more homes being built and just from some areas, even off of Harrogate Road or even in Chester with the old post office where the Walgreens now sits, all that was nothing but woods for years. And that's one of the significant changes in Chester. Obviously, the high school being renovated, that's more of the staple. Thomas Dale was probably more of the staple in Chester. The center of Chester I would say. And that really hasn't changed much, but I think there's just the housing and apartments being built around Chester is probably the biggest landscape change in my opinion. 

Will: Okay. How has your lifestyle changed over time? 

Roby: I would say obviously the older I've got, I've been able to be able to provide more for my family and have a nicer house over time with the job that I have now. And I think that Chester is still a good community to live in, even though it has gained in size and population, it's still a lot smaller than some other communities or some other areas to where you still, a lot of people still do know each other. As for my lifestyle, it's more...My lifestyle really hasn't changed as much over the last 20 years. 

Will: And you see that as a positive that your lives haven't really changed? 

Roby: I would say that, I mean, as a police officer, you know, my job is to protect and serve and whether I live in Chesterfield or work in Chesterfield or not, you know, I still have a job to do and you know, this is still my home where I grew up, that I still feel connected to and I still would look after the people that's in the community. 

Will: Okay. What did Chester use to look like?

Roby: In what kind of period of time? Last 20 years?

Will: This is when you can remember.

Roby: As far back as I can remember, it wasn't as busy. And what I mean by that is it wasn't...The traffic is one of the things I can really note that has really changed over the years that it's a lot more traffic even going from Jeff Davis and Heritage in Route 10 down toward Enon, you know, you go early in the morning or in the evening, it's gonna take you 10 to 15 minutes sometimes because of the amount of traffic. I think that's probably one of the biggest things that's changed over the years which I think is a negative thing. But I mean obviously, it's bringing in more money and bringing them more industry and more jobs to Chester. So obviously it's going to have more traffic. 

Will: So compared to like now like the buildings in Chester, how were the buildings back then? Like were there many or is there not that many?

Roby: I think there's a lot more now. There's definitely a lot more now because there's a lot more new development now that there's a lot more new properties being built and condos, apartments. Like the area around the Walgreens in Chester where Harrogate and Route 10 intersect. That whole area has changed over the years from I remember when I was a kid was just all woods. And you just had a little small Chester post office sitting right there and that was it. There wasn't much around it. You still had the stores that were there, that were on the roadside of Route 10, but nothing behind any of it. And it wasn't a lot of traffic or even people around that area a lot. It was still...I don't want to say it was rural but it was still more suburbs. It's still kind of suburbs, but is becoming more and more city-like with some of the developments that they're building. 

Will: Okay. So Chester in your eyes has basically over the last 20 years, the only appearance that's changed is really like the buildings and the new developments. 

Roby: Yeah. Other than like maybe widened some of the roads. I think Chester itself, you still have a lot of older homes, nice historic-style homes. And I say historic being houses, homes that have built 50, 60 years ago that are still standing and you still have a lot of the original residents that still live in those homes or the resident's families that still live in those homes. It's not an area where every single house is being rented out. Obviously there are some rental houses, but for the most part, you still have families that have established homes that have lived in there for several generations. 

Will: Okay. And what activities did you like to do as a kid? 

Roby: Probably the biggest stuff that I liked to do was playing sports. Baseball, football, basketball, riding my bike. I remember riding my bike as a kid all around through Chester over to the CRA pool and hanging out with friends, playing high school sports. 

Will: Okay. So being like the tight-knit community that helped you more being able to make friends or you're like sticking with your friends. 

Roby: Yeah. I went to Byrd High School, so I knew practically everybody in Thomas Dale High School, just from playing sports with them growing up. The middle schools were split between, you know, Salem, you had Carver Middle School and you had Chester Middle. A lot of kids from Carver went to Byrd and some went to Dale and a lot of those kids integrated. So when we would go out on the weekends or hang out with each other, we were always integrating and mixing girls and guys, dating each other between the schools, hanging out with each other, even though we played sports growing up together though we sort of played against each other in high school. So we were always together, the same parties we all went to. You know, there were Dale parties, there were Byrd parties and there was people from both schools at a lot of the parties. 

Will: Okay. And then how would you say your activities have changed over time? 

Roby: My activities in Chester, obviously I'm not playing sports anymore. But I enjoyed coaching sports. I coached baseball, football, and softball for many years. And I'm still active in the Chester Athletic Association, helping out with all the sports that we offer as well as the football league itself. And helping the Chester Bingo Football Team which is in Chester. 

Will: Okay. And would you say that you still hang out with your friends from back then or has that changed also? 

Roby: There's still a few friends that are still hanging out with and I still communicate with back from when I was younger. Most of the ones that I'm friends with, that I still speak to, most of them are from high school. We all have jobs now that requires us to live in different areas. I believe I was fortunate enough to where I could still stay at home, home being in Chester. And I could still live in Chester, even though I work in Henrico, I have friends that grew up in Chester that are FBI in Atlanta, some work for HCA Healthcare in Ohio. Some live in northern Virginia and are contractors for the government. So I think we've all done very well. But all of them still have family ties here. They still come back to Chester and visit routinely, and we still hang out whenever we get a chance and get free time from our families. 

Will: All right, cool. That's everything, so thank you. 

Roby: Thank you.
