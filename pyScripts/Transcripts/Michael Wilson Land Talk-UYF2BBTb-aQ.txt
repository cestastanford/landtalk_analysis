Interviewer: All right, I'm here with my observer. He's lived in Los Angeles his whole life, been there about 45 years. And so just tell me how Downtown L.A. used to look. 

Interviewee: Back in the days of Downtown L.A. there was all these buildings and stuff, but the cultural-wise...how can I say...it wasn't the safest neighborhood. I would say more African-Americans stayed there. Then as it is now, we're more diverse. So you have basically Hispanics, African-Americans, Caucasians, Asian, Indians, you name it, staying down there now. So they did a whole lot more development down there in Downtown L.A., as in back in the days, they didn't have that much development. 

Interviewer: Can you talk about, like, how much different the city's looked now versus how it looked back then? 

Interviewee: Now the city is looking more like New York, so taller buildings, taller apartments, a lot more lofts, a lot more business. Back in the days, there was more swap meets. So, we used to call it the alley. Now they have more boutique stores. So now you have the Jordan store, Gucci store, you name it. It has some high-end stores instead of just buying t-shirts for $2 or $3. So it is growing tremendously. 

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do there? 

Interviewee: I used to go Downtown. Downtown L.A. was more you go down there to go buy...it's like the garment district. So you go down there to go buy clothes for a cheap, low price. And then another thing that I used to do is go help the homeless because that was more where the skid row and homeless people or people that was on drugs stayed. But now since everything changed and it had the high-end stores and the lofts and the new offices and stuff and the skyrise buildings, they got rid of all of the homeless and skid rows. And now you see more police officers on the streets protecting the streets and protecting the city of Downtown since they built the staples center and hotels and a lot more apartments, skyrise buildings. 

Interviewer: So what are some of the things that you do here now?

Interviewee: Now since all this stuff being built...so I go shopping to the high-end stores. There's a lot more bars, there's a lot more restaurants, great restaurants down there. I have a couple of friends that did buy lofts and apartments and condos down there. So I go hang out with them, go to the game, to the Laker game. Before the Laker Game used to be at the farm and then clippers used to play at the sports arena now they both play in Downtown L.A. at the Staple Center. So it's more entertainment. 

Interviewer: So you think the condition of the city has gotten a lot better?

Interviewee: Oh def-...

Interviewer: I'm talking about like trash, just overall condition of the city, in terms of like sanitary-wise? Or do you think it's relatively the same?

Interviewee: I would say itâ€™s relatively the same because it's more people that are going down there now, but it got better where I'd say the government funded a whole lot more with the police and, you know, people cleaning up. It just wasn't this trash that'd sit there and sit there. And like the homeless, the homeless are not there so they're not making a mess. Like I said, the police now started driving around, like, they're literally walking on the streets or on their bikes going down. So like the parking meters. So it's like back in the days you used to be able to park on the street, now there's parking meters everywhere for the government to make more money.

So it was more funded by the government. So I can say it's cleaner, it's about the same as if you're going clean, but safer, yes. It's way more safer than back in the days. 

Interviewer: With this being said, where do you think the city is going to go 20 years from now? 

Interviewee: Twenty years from now I think it's going to be like a New York. You're going to see more buildings and then it's going to expand more and more into the Inglewood area. So this is going to keep on expanding. And like I said, culturally-wise it's going to be more diverse. You are going to have more Caucasians, more African-Americans, more Hispanics, and Asians buying new properties and living there because it is growing, you know, economically-wise. 

Interviewer: All right, awesome. Thank you, that's it. All right.
