Chris: Hello, my name is Chris Moore, I'm from Orlando, Florida, and this is my friend, Evan. Maybe he can talk a little about where he's from and the location that he's chosen to talk about a change over time.

Evan: Hi, I'm Evan Enriques. I'm from the Big Island of Hawaii. I'm from a beach called Punalu'u. It's a Black Sand Beach out on the Island of Hawaii, and that's what I'm going to be talking about today and how it's changed over the years.

Chris: Okay. So, can you maybe talk about how the beach used to look and I guess how it's changed?

Evan: Yeah. So, the beach is about half a mile long and it used to be sort of like this big mound that used to go straight across the beach. And it used to be just full of sand. The grain is thick because it's lava sand, it's black sand. But, the sand used to be very thick, very little rocks. And it used to be a commonplace for people to go hang out and play. A lot of canoes used to be parked on the sand for the fishermen. And over time, there've been a few changes. One of the main changes has been from human efforts. Within the past 10 years, there has been a recent stop in bulldozing like the mounds of sand, because overtime waves push the sand back into this kind of coconut grove. And without the bulldozing of the sand, it kind of flattens the beach from a mound to a flat area, which kind of erodes...not only erodes the beach, but it kind of showcases a lot of rocks underneath, which makes it a little harder to do a lot of activities in a safe way, such as playing volleyball and surfing on the beach. With all those exposed rocks, you get more of a safety hazard. 

A more environmental way that the beach has changed is from the three tidal waves that have happened within the past five decades. Those three tidal waves has pushed...have also contributed to pushing sand back into that coconut grove and therefore flattening out the beach. So, what you see now on the beach today is a very flat beach with rocks starting to be exposed. And it's still a very, very nice beach, but you are seeing exposure of these big rocks. And whether that is good or good as bad, it's kind of up to the people who visit and the locals who live there. But, I think it's definitely changed the way activities happen at the beach.

Chris: Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what exactly the bulldozing of the sand entailed and how them stopping bulldozing as it changed the landscape?

Evan: Yeah. Yeah. So, there used to be a road that ran behind the beach and there's a bunch of people that live behind in the coconut grove. And what the bulldozer essentially used to do is it used to push sand back up into the mound to create that kind of beach. So, every month they used to do it. And it used to essentially bring the sand back up in a mound, so the sand is really thick and lush. And about 10 years ago, the people living down there thought it was an environmental hazard to have the bulldozer come through every month, and they complained about the noise and kind of all this access that comes with this bulldozer activity. So, it stopped. And now every month, if you don't have that bulldozer coming to push sand out from the coconut grove, sand slowly over time starts to creep into the coconut grove and essentially your beach had been lost in this huge coconut grove. And, like I said, it's flattening out the beach and you're losing sand as it's being pushed back.

Chris: And can you talk about the activities that you used to do when you were a kid when there was more sand there?

Evan: One of my most vivid memories is we used to call it boogie boarding. But essentially, it's where you run down the mound. The mound used to be huge and you run down the mound of sand and you kind of ramp off these waves using these boards. And we used to do all kinds of tricks like backflips, and front flips, and all that kind of stuff. And the tourists used to come by and like, "Oh, that's so cool." But now, since all these rocks are being exposed where we used to run down, and the beach is flattened so you don't have that steep incline anymore, you don't see kids having the ability to do it, not anymore. One, because there's not that hill to run down. And two, because of the safety hazard with all these rocks popping up, kind of being exposed from underneath the sand. And, another activity that we used to do a lot, was we used to bring a volleyball net down and play volleyball. But same thing with all these rocks being exposed from the sand being pushed back, you don't see that as often anymore.

Chris: Okay. And one last thing, can you talk about what activities have changed to now seeing as the rocks are more present and more dangerous? What people do when they go to the beach now?

Evan: Yeah. Nowadays, you see a lot more of recreational activities. So, a lot of people...a lot of tourists come down to hang out and swim. A lot of the local people will come down to the beach and bring their barbecue and grill. And, it's mostly a leisure activity rather than physical activities. I think that's kind of the change that we've seen over time with all this exposure of the rocks.

Chris: And you could say that's just because of the danger of the rocks being exposed.

Evan: Yeah. I think the danger is the main reason that that kind of stuff is happening, especially without the lushness of the sand to kind of...for kids to run around and like fall down without that kind of give [SP] now with all the rocks present, it becomes a safety hazard. And if you're a local, the thing is, you know that. But as a tourist, you might not know that. And that's where the extreme hazard comes, with tourists who don't know the beach and who don't know how it's changed over time.

Chris: Well, thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for taking the time to interview. And, we'll see how the future of the beach, what happens there.

Evan: Thanks.
