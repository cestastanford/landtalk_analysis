Laura: Hi, thank you so much for sitting down with me. I was just kind of curious, since, you know, you've lived in Bend for the past two decades or so, if you could tell me a little bit about the ecology then and now, and how that's changed. You know, animals and plants and all that.

Man: Perfect, yeah. No worries. So, I think one of the biggest things that I've seen through my time here has been kind of the wildlife's shifted. We used to see coyotes all the time. We used to see bobcats all the time. We still, like, hear them occasionally, but we just haven't seen any in years. When we first moved here, they were all over the place. It was just pretty normal sighting, but I don't know if they just moved out of town, too much...too many people, but that's one change I've noticed. The interesting thing is, in the opposite direction, non-predatory animals like some sort of elk, deer, I don't know the exact, like, type of animal, it's like bunnies and stuff, way more of those running around than when I first moved in. I don't know if those are related or not, but I think it's interesting. I also think that...I wish I could tell you more about the birds, but I just don't know enough about the individual species to kinda see what's going on. One super funny story, when I first moved in, me and my wife, we would see these birds, and they would eat some of the old berries that fermented a little bit and fly around all tipsy and stuff, and then a few of them hit my window.

Laura: Oh wow.

Man: We don't see that as often either. I don't know why, if that's the thing or not, but that's just something I remember and I haven't seen in a while. There is one thing I read in the paper, and I kinda see it happening around us, is there's some beetles that are killing these trees, especially around the lake. I don't know...I don't remember what type of beetle but supposedly there's not supposed to be that many, and it's really taking a toll. And also, there's way more weeds here, too. They say invasive weeds. Again, I don't know exactly what kind that are really growing at some crazy rate. It's hard to keep my lawn clean because of all these weeds. But yeah, is there any other things like, I hope I addressed...I got plants and animals, anything else?

Laura: Yeah, that's great. Thank you so much for talking to me. I really appreciate it.

Man: No worries. Yeah. Let me know if you have any other questions.
