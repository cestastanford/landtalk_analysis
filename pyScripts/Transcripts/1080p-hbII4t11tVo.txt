Interviewer: The place that we're going to talk about is the Diamond Head oceanfront in Hawaii. Can you tell me about what this area looked like 40 years ago, and what about 20 years ago?

Interviewee: I can. And the area that we're talking about is about three and a half to four miles between the Waikiki Beach area and the end of Diamond Head Beach. And 40 years ago, there was a considerable beach, I would say about 150 feet wide that you could walk from the end of Waikiki all the way to the end of Diamond Head and now there is no beach and you can't walk any of it.

Interviewer: Can you describe like any other changes that have occurred in this area over the past 20 years?

Interviewee: Well, this area, this beach area was a really great fishing spot for many of the island people who would throw nets. They didn't use poles to fish. They would throw nets because it's very shallow and a lot of it is a reef area and so there was a lot of fishing going on and a lot of activity off beach and into the reef. And they have had to put a moratorium on any fishing in this area because of the fact that there's no beach and the fish can't get in…they can't get in close enough to be active enough to perpetuate fishing in the area. So now there's no fishing and there's no walking on the beach until you get all the way to Diamond Head and there's a small area of beach there where you can walk. But mostly it's just all the open going activities. The surfing and the fishing and the walking have ceased because there is no beach.

Interviewer: That is very sad. How… Do you think this beach will be intact for much longer or are you, unfortunately, expecting this to no longer become a beach area? 

Interviewee: Well, there are those who would say this a cycle, that this is cyclical and that the beach will come back. Sadly it's so drastic and it's so obvious that this is not what's happening in this... In the old days that is what happened, the beach would go out and it would come back in but it will go out over the period of six or seven months and then it would come back in again. The beach has gone out and been out for the last... Let's see, the last time I walked from the Outrigger to the Browns place at Cromwell Beach was 35 years ago.

Interviewer: Wow.

Interviewee: And now there is just a stone wall [inaudible 00:03:17] because you don't want to fall off into two feet of [inaudible 00:03:21] water that used to be beach.

Interviewer: That is very sad. 

Interviewee: It is. 

Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time and for informing me about this area.

Interviewee: It is my pleasure.
