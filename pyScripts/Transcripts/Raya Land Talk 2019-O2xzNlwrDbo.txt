Interviewer: All right. So, my first question is what did Bloomington look like when you first moved here?

Interviewee: Compared to today, Bloomington was, I would say, much greener because of less development. So, now that I look on the outskirts of Bloomington, there's a lot of urban sprawl development and a lot of housing seems like for IU students that used to be more on campus and now is off-campus. And so I've watched a lot of trees cut down and loss of green space.

Interviewer: And so I guess related to that, what kinds of wildlife, any kind,  plants or animals, did you see then I guess versus now. Has that changed at all?

Interviewee: I know that we have a problem with deer because we've destroyed their habitat and some of those wooded areas where the development has happened. Especially, since I live on the west side, all the shopping areas that have come up over the last 20 years or so and when I was growing up was not there. And so now the deer are eating people's vegetables in their vegetable gardens and flowers and I love the deer. But I do see a lot of squirrels in the area. I love to watch the squirrels, raccoons, possums. Â 

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. And then how do you think the, I guess weather or climate has changed? Has it changed at all from 20 years ago?

Interviewee: I have noticed that there seem to be more extreme changes as far as we don't have a spring anymore. Many, many years it goes straight from cold winter to hot summer weather and...although this year is kind of an exception. We've had some pretty nice spring days like yesterday. But yeah, I would say I have noticed and instead of getting steady amounts of rain, it seems like we have a little bit more flooding than I remember in the past where it rains a lot at once.

Interviewer: And then what kind of recreational activities or hobbies have you been able to pick up here?

Interviewee: Well, I no longer have a boat. But we used to have a boat and enjoy Lake Monroe and so I used to ski. So, we did skiing behind the boat and camping on Lake Monroe. And since I live in between Bloomington and Ellettsville I can garden. So, I still have been gardening for a long time.

Interviewer: Nice.

Interviewee: I would say that's it as far as my outdoor. I love to walk. Just go on hikes, I guess that's a hobby.

Interviewer: Yeah. Would you say there's more I guess green space where you live where I guess, compared to maybe closer to Bloomington?

Interviewee: Right. Yes. I would agree that because I'm in between Bloomington and Ellettsville. And so I guess it's still considered suburban area but yeah. We have a lot of areas where we can walk safely, have sidewalks and park areas. I love [inaudible 00:03:56].

Interviewer: And then have there been any major weather events like big storms or anything that have happened?

Interviewee: Yes. My first home that I owned, there were two different storms both involved straight-line winds. There was a tornado associated with one of those storms but they did not say that the tornado was over our house but it was nearby. So, they called it straight-line winds. We had an above ground pool at the time. A tree fell on the pool and all the water just went gushing out of the pool in the summer. So, I had to have that repaired. And then there was another time when straight-line winds caused a pine tree to puncture through our roof. And so yeah. Water was literally running through into the dining room through the roof.

Interviewer: That's pretty major.

Interviewee: So, yes.

Interviewer: Wow. And then okay. The last question I have is what do you like the most about living here?

Interviewee: In terms of the ecosystem or people or just anything?

Interviewer: I guess anything.

Interviewee: I love the diversity and I love that people are down to earth and I think their priorities are in place here. We're not as materialistic I believe for the most part in Monroe...well, in the Bloomington area. And everybody seems supportive of education in the community in general.

Interviewer: I definitely agree.

Interviewee: And there are a lot of fun things to do too associated with IU but also community events and parks and nature trails and...

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: It's a good community.

Interviewer: All right. Well, that is all. Thank you so much for doing this.

Interviewee: You're very welcome.

Interviewer: Yeah. That's it.

Interviewee: Okay.

Interviewer: All right.
