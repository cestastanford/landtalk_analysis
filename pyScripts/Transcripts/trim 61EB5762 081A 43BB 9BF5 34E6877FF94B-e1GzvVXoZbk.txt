Interviewer 1: Yes. Now. 

Interviewer 2: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. What did downtown Menlo Park used to look like?

Interviewee: Well, let me answer that question. So, downtown Menlo Park didn't have as many buildings, didn't have as many apartments and condominiums and houses. But downtown was still fun. Families could ride their bikes there. They could go to the park, they would go get bagels. They would go to Kepler's, but Kepler's was really, really tiny. It was a tiny bookstore, now it's really big, and a great bookstore. And it's next to Borrone's. Borrone's wasn't there either.

Interviewer 3: Thank you. What did Las Lomitas used to look like? 

Interviewee: Oh my goodness. Mrs. Nettle's room. This is Peterson's room, and Mrs. Gordon's old classroom weren't there a long time ago. The library wasn't here. The computer lab wasn't here. Cano Hall was here. We didn't have that property then. I'm trying to think. The library used to be in a classroom, believe it or not. It used to be where the teachers eat their lunch. Can you imagine the library was small, but it was still really good? We didn't have all that beautiful playground equipment. We had nice equipment, but it wasn't that fancy schmancy. And we didn't have portables here. And we only had 19 teachers in the old Las Lomitas, and now we have over 37 teachers. 

Interviewer 4: How has Kepler's changed?

Interviewee: How has Kepler's changed?

Interviewer 4: Yes.

Interviewee: Kepler's used to be a really tiny store, and now it's way big. Way big. And it has big windows, and it has a lot of books and a lot of people that help. It also has great children's books now. So, Kepler's has gotten really big. 

Children: Thank you for sharing with us.
