Calee: My name is Calee Martin and I'm interviewing my dad, Matt Martin. And we are talking about where we grew up in Denver. So Dad, do you want to talk about the ways Denver used to look? 

Matt: Yeah. I would say Denver, it's been a combination of like, different boom cycles or whatever where, you know, there's houses in kind of the old neighborhoods where it might have been built in the late 1800s. And then there might have been another burst of home building that happened in early 1920s, and 1940s, 1960s and so on. So, you know, the... And I would say as well in the 80s, I think Denver, the economy wasn't so great. So, you know, some of the neighborhoods in Denver kind of stagnated, and there wasn't a lot of new growth and new building happening. So, that's kind what has happened in the past. 

Calee: So, what do you think has changed most?

Matt: Well, Denver has become, because of the migration to Denver due to job opportunities, you know both technology, different industries that have exploded here, it's just a desirable place to live. It's brought a lot more people with money to invest. And that's caused the developers to build new structures and premium houses in a lot of these old Denver neighborhoods that weren't very nice. 

Calee: Yeah. So, before that, what did you used to do for fun, shall we say?

Matt: Yeah, I mean I would say that the parks... There are a lot of nice parks around in the neighborhood, the city and the area. And, you know, those have started to,,, I would say those have seen more investment now, too. Those are things that are starting to see more money, better structures, better upkeep. 

Calee: So, you would say now like, what would you do now that the area has changed? Is there any new things that you do?

Matt: Yeah, I would walk around more, and feel comfortable going to more locations and places. There's less of a concern about, you know, open crime, if you will, in neighborhoods. It's just freedom of mobility to go to the places you wanna go. More outdoor stuff. 

Calee: Awesome. Well, thank you for talking with me today. 

Matt: You are most welcome. 

Calee: Okay.
