Interviewer: Yeah.

Katie: My name is Katie Howarth Ryan, and I'd like to tell you about a small town in rural Wisconsin called Cooksville. And I've lived in Wisconsin for almost 35 years. I moved from Manhattan, so it was really a discovery of what agricultural land was like and what living right, sort of, next to nature was like for me.

Interviewer: So, when did you first move there? Like what was...Yeah, when did you first move there, what was it like?

Katie: Well, when I moved there in 1986, yeah, I sort of naively thought I was, you know, moving to some sort of country that I was more familiar with, but it turns out it's very different. And there, it's a historic town because it was platted by New Englanders who had a common green and then some houses. But, of course, it didn't grow very much, so there are some houses, but mostly it's still surrounded by farmland. And when I moved there in 1986, there was tobacco being grown all over this area in Wisconsin, and you'd see the long tobacco barns with slatted sides that allowed for the tobacco to dry, and you'd look over the fields and you could see the large broad-leaf tobacco plants.

There was a general store in Cooksville that sold supplies to the tobacco farmers. And there'd be huge tobacco barns, this yellow cream brick building with different kinds of tobacco brands painted on the side in towns like Edgerton or Evansville or Stoughton. So, Cooksville just happens to be a village of about 90 people in this rural setting. So when I first moved there, it was largely agricultural in between Madison, Wisconsin, the capital, and small towns and cities surrounding it, like there'd be to the south Beloit where Beloit College is, or you know, or Janesville, which has like 60,000 people.

But mostly it was a community of farmers, and living in the country and being able to see this large, expansive horizon is very different than the East Coast. And it's really a place where the land and the weather makes a big difference. So, for instance, when I was growing up, you could look across the water and you would see the clouds in a large expanse, but in Wisconsin, you'll look across the land and it's flat enough that you see the clouds stretching to the horizon line, and the land itself is mostly cultivated, mostly farming or dairy farming. 

So I first moved there, it had the tobacco farms, but then over time...and it had been farmed historically. You know that Wisconsin was...the town was founded around 1838, and it was largely people who are moving there to be farmers and then pursue whatever other, you know, sort of industry they could have. But as time went on, and tobacco companies left Wisconsin and we're no longer growing tobacco there, other crops stepped in, like people would grow soybeans for instance. That's a huge crop now still in Wisconsin, or the family farms began to change and get larger and larger, so instead of a 40-acre farm supporting a family, it would be 160 acres supporting 700 cows and a family.

And so, for instance, the use of the general store in town, which was the longest running, continuous running general store in Wisconsin, used to have its livelihood from farmers, but now they would get, you know, simple supplies and implements. But now it became more sort of like a stop for bicyclists or, you know, they couldn't really carry as much because, you know, they weren't making as much money, but anyway, eventually it's still operating and it's just found different ways to exist over time. But the farming life still exists in this area, but it's slowly changed, the crops have changed, and then this is the heart of where there are government subsidies for not growing [inaudible 00:04:44] crops.

So there's a lot of land use issues here, and I was on a zoning board for 12 years. So in the townships, there could be, for instance, this idea that you want to preserve ag land, so that you can be in the federal credit program, or you want to...you know, they want to...well, that's the main...it's a huge incentive. The other thing that happens is sometimes farm families want to split off a house with some acres, maybe for, you know, a child or some other family members so they can have their own house or they build a new house, but then what often happens is then eventually that house gets sold to somebody who's not a part of the family farm. And there was more, sort of, residential creep from towns like Madison or Stoughton or Oregon or Evansville, people wanting to have a little bit more land and build their own new home. 

So ag land, which was inexpensive comparative to residential lots, like $2,000 an acre, people could buy the minimum required, and in some places, like if it was rural residential, it'd be 3 acres, it's the smallest lot you could have, or if it's ag land, let's pretend it's like 15 acres above. So basically, there were more and more houses and initially, farmers would sell it on like a woodlot or something that was not productive. But then, over time, as residential homes and the prices people are willing to pay rose, more development came in. But still, the township zoning was trying to keep it within the ag sort of land because...

Interviewer: [crosstalk 00:06:38] subsidies?

Katie: Yeah, for the credits and the programs that they could qualify for federally. The thing about living out in the country instead of in the city, for instance, for me initially, were things like, once I was outside in the yard working in the yard, and I heard this whooshing sound and I asked my neighbor who was, in this case, quite close by like, "What highway was that I was hearing in the background?" I'm like, "Which?" I was trying to figure out which road this was, and he said, "Katie, that's the wind in the pines." So literally, I really, you know, couldn't translate the wind in the pines, there are beautiful mature white pines, to being something natural, so that was kind of funny. 

And then another time I was at my house and my neighbor again called me and said, "Katie, go to the end of your driveway, the Northern lights are out." And so sure enough in Cooksville where there are no street lights, people don't have bright lights on their houses, it was totally dark, you could see beautiful stars and beautiful Northern lights. Farms tend to have very bright lights in their driveways or near the barns or whatever, but this particular little village didn't have a...it has some farms on the outskirts, but not in these two small blocks.

Interviewer: Right, it's like there's two blocks of residential surrounded by farmland, kind of?

Katie: Yes, exactly. And then the farmland, there was a lot of corn, a lot of things to support dairy farming, the crops to support cows, but then this area became mostly soybean. So it's like, I dunno, soybean capital of Wisconsin, you know. And there were still big canning factories around like Libby's and known brands, but the land is also used for recreation, and so tourism and hunting, you know, are both two big uses for land. So, you know, in the area, that was another thing that was unusual is that, you know, come November, if you're driving around the countryside, there'll be these cars parked by the side of the road and you look to the left or the right, and sure enough you'll see people in blaze orange down in the fields.

Interviewer: [crosstalk 00:09:09] hunting. Do people still do that with like more residential...like more houses around? Is it still...?

Katie: Well yes, actually they do, and so, like, sort of, when there's a farm on the outskirts of, like, little cluster of homes, that's often a conflict, because, you know, people will complain about...But obviously, any responsible hunter should know...

Interviewer: What they're going through.

Katie: ...what they're doing.

Interviewer: Right.

Katie: You know, not to point in that direction, but you will hear the shots and, you know, and you really should not take your dog on a walk over the fields, for instance, because the deer are out and the hunters are out. But in Wisconsin, though agriculture, historically, was the largest, you know, endeavor. Tourism had been very big, and part of that is the hunting, so a lot of people will have some acres "up north," as they say, and maybe a cabin or something that they go to for hunting week or, I remember when I was...I was trying to get a house project done, and I was talking to the contractor and they're like, "Well, we're not going to be able to work, you know, from this date to that date." And I'm like, "Oh, okay, why not?" "Well, it's hunting season." So, you know, your plumber's gone, everybody goes hunting. So that's a different way that people relate to the land and the wildlife.

Interviewer: It's sort of persisted throughout the whole time even?

Katie: Oh yeah. There is a lot of manufacturing in Wisconsin, but not in the area that I'm talking about, and this is really...there are parts slightly north that have more rock outcroppings, but this is really prime ag land.

Interviewer: Yeah, and so just sort of like, loopback to something you mentioned earlier that at least other villages are like built around a green, and so like a preserved green space and there's like a little forest there. So, how do you think like the...like does that act sort of like a center for like activities and like community life? How do you think, like, that like land is sort of set apart, like...?

Katie: Right. So historically, what happened in this area of Wisconsin was there were things called the oak savannas, and so before it was farmed land, it was these grasses, savannas, and they had like baroque mostly or different oak trees. So you'd have an open grassy area and then clusters of oak trees, and sometimes they'd be clustered along ridges near a lake, like the Badfish Creek near Cooksville. But in this case, the Porter family from Massachusetts who actually bought part of the land from Daniel Webster moved...

Interviewer: Who was one of the early...

Katie: "The" Daniel Webster, so yeah, he was really just a speculator, but a land speculator. Anyway, the Porters came and they platted the village the way a New England village would be, so there was a common space that was set aside for an organization of the town around the common space, and for many years, the schoolhouse was on that green, now it's a community center, and there was a nice oak wood, and then some maples, sugar maples and, you know, of course, because of oak wilt, now there's a lot of concern to preserve the oaks, to replant some oaks, and to kind of care for these areas. And then, but outside there are these very large farms, so mostly now it's probably [inaudible 00:12:58] soybean or a lot of it is not even, again, not cultivated on purpose.

Interviewer: I remember one thing you mentioned, at some point, a while ago is how...like the way that you...like how you would take walks in Cooksville was sort of dictated by like farmers' plots or like the farm [crosstalk 00:13:17].

Katie: Yeah, what it is, is like, for instance, at Cooksville, you can walk...it's one mile around Cooksville. But outside of Cooksville that has smaller platted roads, it's very large gridwork that's based on farms, and most of the farms are 40 acres to start, so you might have several farms if you're well to do. But so, that means that if we were going to go for a walk outside Cooksville, and we were going to stay on the paved area, you'd walk like five miles to get around the square. You could ask permission of the farmers to walk across their land and a lot of people would allow you to do that, but basically, you know, you can't...A city block is different, but it's sort of like the rural equivalent of a city block.

Interviewer: Like a very large city block?

Katie: Yeah. Yeah, it's really kind of neat. But over time, you know, there's still...like for instance, there's still coyotes, there's still turkeys, there's still these little like groundhogs, there's still deer, obviously.

Interviewer: Yeah, the prairie dogs [inaudible 00:14:33].

Katie: Oh, the prairie dogs, that's what I was trying to say. So I don't feel like the nature...excuse me, the wildlife, despite the more population, it wasn't populous enough to prevent the wildlife from being there.

Interviewer: Yeah. Like, it's sort of maybe...like you say, it's sort of a similar, like...or like it's a slightly different density, but like the lands, do you think it's being like cultivated less now or? Like is it [crosstalk 00:14:59] agriculture?

Katie: I think it is a little bit cultivated...yes, I think it is cultivated less. Also, farms are so productive now that there's, you know, as you know, there's overproduction, and so they don't need to be cultivating as much. So there'll be things like a corn maze for fun or different uses of the land.

Interviewer: Yeah. So I feel like one of the things that like is pretty important for Cooksville is that it is like so close to Madison, which is like a really...you know, like the capital and like a really big commuter town, I think. Do you feel like it's sort of shifted to being more of like almost a Madison suburb or like not to that point? Or like, you know, like the residence and stuff?

Katie: Yeah, I think the thing about Cooksville, because it's a village of about 90 people, and it is a designative historic district, federal, national register of historic places. so people who live there are interested in probably historic preservation, but they want to be in the country, but they like to have some neighbors, but they don't mind that they don't have city services, you know, everybody's got their own septic and well. And so I think that it's been a commuting town from elsewhere for a pretty long time if you lived in the village. But earlier, there were a lot of either farmers or people that work near the farms or, you know, relatives that lived in Cooksville, and so that did fall away too, yes, being more people that commuted elsewhere for their jobs. There were lots of people who worked in...I don't know why, but there were a lot of teachers in Cooksville, some that worked in Stoughton, some worked as far away as Beloit, some in Madison, so that did make a difference.

Interviewer: Yeah. Do you feel like, I guess when you were moving out...I guess from like comparing like Cooksville when you first moved there to now, or even like in Madison, let's say where you currently are, do you feel like the way people think of or treated the plots of land that their homes are on is different or the way they approached...versus having a very carefully manicured yard, do you think it's more trying to preserve some of the natural stuff that's there, or what do you think?

Katie: Well, it's funny because...

Interviewer: Or is it more agriculture?

Katie: No, it's just funny because when I was in Cooksville, having grown up outside of New York and New Jersey, and here's my first home that I own after living in apartments, I'm out there raking the leaves in the fall, and my neighbor lived in Cooksville for 20 years by then is like, "Katie, what are you doing? We don't have to do that." You know, I'm like, "You don't?" Like, "No, no, you just do that once in the spring." I'm like, "Oh, okay, that's good enough." So there's a lot less concern about...there's no concern practically about manicured yards. I mean, people are interested in gardening. I was very interested in the trees on our property because we had a lot of unusual trees, like a sycamore tree, European large tamarack, horse chestnut, things that the previous...the owners in like the '20s had planted, so...

Interviewer: Yeah, wasn't there like a garden? Like [crosstalk 00:18:31].

Katie: Yeah, there had been a very elaborate garden that a gentleman named Ralph Warner had planted behind our house, which had almost like little, you know, patterned little walks and whatnot, but so that...and he had a little pond that was turned into a sandbox when we were there, but...So compared to Madison where there's much more of a concern, I mean there's even ordinances that you cut your grass, it's not that people don't cut...people cut their grass in Cooksville, but there's also some prairie restoration going on in Cooksville, so there is some land managed with burns and whatnot...

Interviewer: [crosstalk 00:19:14], yeah.

Katie: ...but, so, you know.

Interviewer: I think that started...Is that more recent, or is that always sort of been...?

Katie: No, that's probably within the last...probably the last 15 years. There are a few of them, one is the farm that's the closest to the intersection with 59 and 138, where there's a little stream and they have like maybe 20 acres that goes from cultivated land to a creek, which is very marshy. And then there's another area that's further up out the hill that the people just wanted to do. So they just put their land in prairies...

Interviewer: Nice.

Katie: ...and they...it takes a while to establish it, but now they have restored it. And that's just a look back to that oak savanna, you know, somebody...it's a person who wants to do it, they want to make it...I mean, it's not low maintenance in a way for a while, but they want to make it recall that natural...

Interviewer: Right, like where it was before...

Katie: Yeah.

Interviewee: ...prior to...?

Katie: Yeah.

Interviewer: Interesting.

Katie: And there still are things out there like 4-H and whatnot but, you know, far fewer people are going into farming now. So the land use has changed, the economy has changed, somewhat, yes, the people who live there are different.

Interviewer: Yeah. I guess it's sort of like one more like general question and then you could do maybe some wrapup. So I was just wondering, just as you moved out of Cooksville eventually, I was wondering, like, do you feel like you relate to it or like...like the land or does like visiting differently like living there versus now not living there, like [crosstalk 00:21:02] and stuff?

Katie: Oh yes, sure. Like for instance, when I lived there, I mean every day you could wake up and look across the green, see the outline of the oak trees branching over the...leaning over the green and beyond oak trees at the edge of the farm field, and there was sunrise. So, you know, and it was free, and it was free of buildings, this field. So, you know, you really feel like you're out in it. Or if you wanted to...like when kids were little, you know, you want to go build a snowman, you run out on the green and you build a snowman. Or if you want to...and you've got all this expanse around you. Or if you want to go see the sunset, you walk up a hill and you're looking over rolling farmland. So it's quite a different experience because you're out there in nature all the time. There are no stores besides the general store and no sidewalks. I mean, you're just a part of the land. 

Whereas in Madison, where I live now, I happen to live near a park, and so...but it's a very different experience because, for instance, in Cooksville, if I saw an owl, it would be flying low across the green like, you know, hunting. And in Madison, when I hear an owl, it's up in a tree near my house stationary because there are buildings and trees and you're not going to get that kind of view. So it's a different...nature is still clearly there, and I'm kind of surprised like I've seen bald eagles at a pond near this park, but...Yeah, so it's still kind of...oh, I've seen a red fox go down the street.

Interviewer: Yeah, it was running down the street, in the middle of the street, yeah.

Katie: Yeah, that is just crazy. So, but again, there's way too much light to see Northern lights or even the stars for that matter. So, stars in Cooksville were beautiful and there was a big expanse of them because there was this large open space. So I think now to get that kind of experience when I go visit Cooksville or go elsewhere, you know, I'm intentionally going there for that, whereas I just lived among it, which was a different feeling, and I got used to the wind in the pines.

Interviewer: Yeah, eventually.

Katie: Yes.

Interviewer: And so, it sounds like people worked a lot to make sure the Cooksville stayed like preserved, I guess, or like with the natural lands. Or at least it sort of worked out that way.

Katie: Yes. I think people do care about a lot. There are lots of different groups, like there's a group that's trying to restore the oak trees on the green and preserve what's there, and there are groups that are interested in the buildings, and then there is a community center that brings people together for different programs, some of which...like there was one recently with two gentlemen, Larry Reed and Jerry Apps who talked about the history of one-room schoolhouses, including Cooksville's one-room schoolhouse and the role that it played among the farm families, especially initially. So, there are people there that are concerned about the land, you know, and Wisconsin has a huge history with Aldo Leopold and John Muir and people that are interested in not just the utility of the land but the beauty of the land.

Interviewer: Yeah. Do you have any final thoughts on there, like...?

Katie: Well, I think wherever...I think that living in Wisconsin and among these kinds of rolling farmlands, as a person who was used to mountains growing up and used to more just forests or different kinds of environment, I really came to appreciate the rolling farmlands and the huge horizon that you can see, and the fact that weather really matters, you know?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Katie: Whether its...You know, in New York, if you're talking about the weather, like, you know, you really are...it's an empty conversation. If you're talking about the weather in Wisconsin, it can mean anything from, you know, like flooding, tornadoes, or a beautiful sunny summer day, so that's been really different, but I think that wherever I am, nature's an important thing, so I'm glad that I've had this experience.

Interviewer: Yeah. All right, thank you.

Katie: Welcome.
