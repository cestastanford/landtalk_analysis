Interviewer: So you said you lived where, for how long?

Interviewee: San Mateo County for 45 years now.

Interviewer: Forty-five. That's awesome. So, yeah, I just have a few brief questions about the area. First, like, could you describe how the place looked like, you know, when you first got there, like what you can kind of remember what it looked like then?

Interviewee: Sure. I remember it was more rural when I was growing up in Daly City. Like, surrounding our house were fields where there would be jackrabbits, deers.

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. That's awesome.

Interviewee: Deers, jackrabbits, fields to play. No traffic and really fun. I mean, like, rode our bikes. And we were like everything we did was outside.

Interviewer: That's awesome.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: And then can you kinda describe, like, maybe throughout the years, how it's changed like, you know…

Interviewee: So I'd say in the mid-'80s, more housing went up around the area and the neighborhood. There were less fields, less wildlife. And throughout, I mean, I'd say since the mid-'80s, it's just been non-stop housing...

Interviewer: Exploded, yeah.

Interviewee: ...being built. Not only that, a lot more dense housing, like a lot more condominiums, a lot apartments, yeah. 

Interviewer: Like, a lot more urban and stuff. Sure.

Interviewee: We had a two-story house and nothing…like all the surrounding business were all mom-and-pop shops.

Interviewer: You mean...

Interviewee: Starting in the mid-'80s and until now, there's…now there's like six-story condos or maybe, like, four or five-story condos. Big-box retailers, chain stores, chain restaurants.

Interviewer: Right. Yeah, just like that urbanization.

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. So, like, how did that change? How you find that interacted with the area, like, as you were, like, growing up, and how you do that now, that thing?

Interviewee: I mean, as a kid, I thought it was cool. I mean, along with that came, like…with the restaurants came, like, techno…like what we thought was high-tech stuff with arcades and video games. Like, we were no longer, like, playing, like, you know, building forts and playing dirt. We were saving our allowance and spending it on the arcade games, riding our bikes to the mall now and go to the arcade or go to the pizzeria. Like, every place had, like, arcades, so we kinda liked it. We still like it. We kind of like it. Like, it was gradual. It wasn't like, bam, all of a sudden.

Interviewer: Yeah. Right. Just over time kind of thing.

Interviewee: Yeah, but there were still, like, a lot of parks to play, a lot of the basketball courts, a lot of baseball fields, tennis courts, and stuff like that, so still a lot to do.

Interviewer: Sure. So, like, can you describe, like, yeah, what you do now kind of thing, like in a sense?

Interviewee: Now? Well, now, I'm still in San Mateo County. I live in San Bruno, which is about 5 miles south of where I grew up. And I've been there now for, like, 17 years, 17 years.

Interviewer: It's still, like, relatively the same area kind of thing? Yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah, I mean, it's a bike ride away.

Interviewer: Sure. Sure.

Interviewee: But when I moved there until now, like what I've noticed a lot more is just the density of the population, so now, when it's...

Interviewer: So many more people around this area.

Interviewee: Yeah. Like, or back then when it was, like, you know, a family of four in every house, it seems to me, like, every house is sometimes two or three family units, really dense and a lot more people around.

Interviewer: Yeah. So you think that, like… I don't know. Would you describe, like, the land is, like, a little less beautiful or just like you have to kind of go out of your way to kinda get it than you had when you were younger?

Interviewee: Yeah. I mean, there's a lot more cars. Like, when it used to be just, like, wide open spaces, like I said, we'd play football in the street where now...

Interviewer: That was the same thing we had in Wisconsin.

Interviewee: Yeah. We played football in the street, and we could get in, like, an hour of playing before a car came by.

Interviewer: Before a car came. Yeah, right.

Interviewee: And now, it's like I wouldn't even have my kids cross that street...

Interviewer: That's right. Yeah.

Interviewee: …unless you're at the crosswalk down the street. A lot more cars, a lot more people. Like, there's still a lot of, like, wildlife and trees. But, yeah, there's just a lot more… Like it's a lot less nature.

Interviewer: Sure. Awesome.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Well, yeah. No. Awesome. Thank you.

Interviewee: Sure.

Interviewer: Appreciate that. I think that's...
