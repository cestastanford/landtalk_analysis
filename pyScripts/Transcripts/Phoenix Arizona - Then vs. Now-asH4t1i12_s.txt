Woman: So, 20 years ago in Phoenix compared to now...It was a lot less traffic and fewer freeways. It was more...a lot more surface street...well, there's still surface street used now, but you can get around a lot more on freeways now. Because, in the last...certainly in the last 20 years, they've built a lot of freeways here. It's still, though, really easy to get around, and like, a lot of parking, and even Downtown is relatively easy to get around compared to downtowns in other place. But, it's gotten busier and more crowded. 

The environment outside compared to now was fairly similar to how it is now, it's just, there's been, like, some sprawl. So, the borders of where people live has gotten pushed out certainly north. I don't know much about east, and west, and south, but a lot of development going north. But, the basic style is pretty similar. And, even kind of the density's kind of similar in a lot of ways, like there's the same type of big yards and things like that.

The landscape was pretty similar, you see a lot of...The newer areas are a lot more desert landscaping. They always have been some, but the new construction tends to be almost...or, the new areas tend to be very desert-y landscape. As not like in central Phoenix, there's kind of the green belt. But, you don't see as much of that on that outlying areas as there is where they're building out.

In the summertime, it's too hot to do much outside at all, but when the weather's nice, it's, you know, people like to go hiking and...you know there's just not like a ton to do because in the summer, it is so hot. But people like to go to the zoo, and they go to the botanical gardens, and they go Downtown. I think that the biggest difference is, there's a lot more to do Downtown. It use to be Downtown was totally dead. Like, there was just nothing going on Downtown, which made it really easy to get around, and to park, and on the weekends there was nothing going on Downtown. I think that that's changing. It's a lot more of a Downtown-life now than there was 20 years ago, for sure. That's the biggest difference.

Swimming pools, basically. Not everybody, but you know, I would say probably most houses have swimming pools, at least people I know. Which isn't, you know, obviously necessarily everybody. But, there doesn't seem to be a difference in the number of people who have...the relative numbers of people who have swimming pools, it's just very common. I don't use it all that much, but I didn't 20 years ago either, so.

Interviewer: Okay, anything else?

Woman: There's not a huge amount of outdoor life in the Phoenix-area for a lot of the year because of the heat, but people do go, like, the same things. People will go to Flagstaff, or Prescott, or Payson or whatever, and Sedona, where it's little cooler in the summer. So, there's a lot of that kind of outdoor activity in other areas in the state. But, Phoenix itself is just not a huge outdoor place because there's not a lot to do in the winter, and in the summer, it's just too hot.

Basically, the most interesting thing, and the biggest change is Downtown. I remember thinking, because I moved here from Chicago, and Downtown in Chicago was, like, a big deal. It was, like, very busy and very active and a lot of cultural stuff going on, and there was nothing, Downtown was sort of depressing when I first moved here. And now there's a Downtown life, they have, like, First Fridays, and they have the art walks, and they have all this stuff that they didn't have when I moved here. That's a fairly big change. The other big change is the freeways. There's just a lot more of them. But Phoenix itself looks...it really isn't that different in a lot of ways than it was 20 years ago. Except, it's, as I said, it's just sprawled outward.
