Interviewer: Okay, what place will you be talking about?

Interviewee: I'm going to talk about Bloomington, Indiana. 

Interviewer: What do you remember from when you first moved here?

Interviewee: I remember it being a beautiful place. It was hilly. It has a lot of trees and it had more of a small town feel compared to now, you know, in the last few years. 

Interviewer: Okay. What was your favorite part about living here? And... yeah.

Interviewee: The beauty of Southern Indiana. The hills, the trees and, you know the parks around it and also Lake Monroe has some nice spots.

Interviewer: What animals have you seen here?

Interviewee: I've seen many deer, sometimes in groups. That was neat. And then, I've seen different kinds of birds. And, you know, the squirrels, skunks and different... Yeah. 

Interviewer: What kinds of trees and plants where or are here?

Interviewee: There are a lot of evergreens, a lot of oak trees, and just the different... I need to see all the different varieties, yeah. 

Interviewer: How has the weather changed, and were there any big storms in the last 20 years?  

Interviewee: I remember some ice storms that, you know, we had power out for nearly two days on one of the times. So, there have been some ice storms where the electricity would go out. And then a few times, you know, we had severe winter, a lot of snow. That was neat, and winds. Thankfully, we don't have any tornadoes but, you know, we do get warnings and it does get very windy sometimes. 

Interviewer: What do you miss most about living here 20 years ago, or how has Bloomington changed?

Interviewee: It's changed. More buildings have come up downtown. It's kind of nice some things were redone, like the bus station looks really nice. And I don't know if I would say if I miss anything. Maybe some of the trees that were taken down by the Highway 69 that's being built. So, I miss a little bit of that where they had to remove trees to build the highway. But otherwise, I think it's a lot of things that I still appreciate. 

Interviewer: How has the scenery in Bloomington changed over the last 20 years?

Interviewee: Just as an example, in the house that I lived in for like 24 years, I remember the trees were really... When we planted the trees, they were just four feet tall. And now they're over 60 feet tall and a lot more birds. It's neat to see that, so it's, you know, it's changed. It looks good.
