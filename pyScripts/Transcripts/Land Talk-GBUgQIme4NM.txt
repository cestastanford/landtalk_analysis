Chetan: Hi there. I'm with my mother, Smita Rane, and she's gonna tell us about a place which she is familiar with. Can you please tell us the name of this location, please?

Smita: Hi, Chetan. I would like to talk to you about the place called Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. It is located in one of the suburbs of Mumbai in India, and it's basically a colony for families of people who work at the Atomic Research Center.

Chetan: Awesome. So you've been familiar with this place for over 20 years. And I'm wondering how this place used to look back in around 1990?

Smita: So this is a very beautiful place because it is nestled next to a mountain and at that time in the 1990s, there wasn't much construction or even any other housings around the colony. The colony was a gated community. So it was pretty much aloof from the rest of the chaotic Mumbai City.

Chetan: And over the past 20 to 30 years, how has this place changed?

Smita: Oh, well, a lot has changed, Chetan. I can talk about the flora. Basically, when I was living in that colony, we had a lot of mango trees. It was a mango forest. There were different types of wild shrubs that grew close to the mountains and it had beautiful green lawns surrounding the buildings for the family so the kids could play.

Chetan: That sounds nice. And what sort of changes have taken place, you know, ever since there were a lot of mango trees and a lot of flora and fauna as you described?

Smita: Oh, so basically the colony is pretty big. However, you know, there's always demand for new families. So we always had this ongoing construction and I cannot tell you the exact number, but definitely, a lot of new buildings have cropped up. In terms of the flora and fauna, like I mentioned, there were a lot of mango trees.

So, you know, now when I recently went back in 2014, the mango trees have died. You know, so now the people have replaced the mango trees with palm trees, and that is a big change for me going back because we loved to climb the mango trees and pluck, you know, the raw mangoes, so we miss that.

I would also like to mention that we also had a lot of wildlife there, and I'm talking about monkeys. We had a lot of monkeys, we had a lot of snakes because, like I mentioned, there were a lot of wild shrubs and bushes. So we always had to be very careful around snakes. There were a lot of squirrels and beautiful birds. And I think now the population of the snakes has gone down. That is what I have heard from the people who currently live there.

Chetan: That's interesting. So what are some of the things that you used to do their back in, you know, the early 1990s?

Smita: So I was an engineering student. So basically, I was, you know, doing my education at that time. We also had a lot of facilities inside the colony. Like, we had tennis courts, we had, like, you know, a nice place where people could...community center sort of where people could go and take classes for singing and, you know, dancing. So it was really a very family-oriented place where you could do any type of activities and everything was enclosed within the fencing of the colony. So it was a very safe place for kids to even go by themselves anywhere.

Chetan: Awesome. And now, over the past few years, as you mentioned, a lot of the things have changed in terms of the wildlife and the construction. What are some of the things that you do there now when you go visit and when you're around some of your friends and family in that area?

Smita: One big change that I would like to also mention is security. When I was there in the 1990s, we could just go around anywhere. But now, because of lot of reasons which I don't want to talk about here, but we have a lot of security guards all around the colony and we don't have as much freedom to go around, you know, because, after a certain time, they will come and ask you, you know, who you are, what you're doing.

So also, like, people from outside who come into the colony, it's a very tedious job now. They need special permission to visit anybody inside. So that part has changed, but in terms of the facilities, in terms of the beautiful grasses, you know, the parks, everything is still the same.

Chetan: That's great to hear. So it seems like, you know, while a lot of things have changed over the past many years, the facilities and the wildlife is pretty similar. Are there any other things you would like to add about the changes to this place over the past 20 years or does that pretty much sum all of it?

Smita: I think that is pretty much the summation of what I have noticed. So I would really like to thank the whole community, the whole colony to, you know, keeping the greenery and keeping everything beautiful still. It is still a very beautiful colony to visit.

Chetan: Great. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.

Smita: Thank you, Chetan. Thanks.
