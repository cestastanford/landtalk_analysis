Interviewer: One.

Vic Strife: Hi, I'm Vic Strife. I moved to Monroe County, Indiana in 1997 and I think the biggest change that I can recall since that time is there used to be a television plant, NRCA plant, at the corner of Rogers and Grimes. It was still in production. They were making televisions when I first moved here and they actually named a local park after i. And then they closed the plant and then sometime after they closed the plant, moved their production down to Mexico or so the local paper said. The city tore the building down and for years there was nothing on that lot except grass and then eventually a dermatologist's office was built at the corner. And then just a few years ago, another doctor's office was built right next to that. Mostly though, it's still a big empty piece of land. There are other businesses that have closed down while I've lived here, but that's the one that I find most memorable, probably because I lived near it for awhile and I lived near that park.

Interviewer: What did the weather used to be like here?

Vic Strife: In my memory when I first moved to Indiana, which was actually Richmond, Indiana in 1993, my experience of the winters here was that they were very long and very, very gray, and we used to get a lot of snow. We don't get zero snow now, but it seems to me we get significantly less snow than we used to and I miss it. I liked the snow. We moved within the county a few years ago and we moved to a hill and I thought the kids who were still young enough to do stuff like that at the time would sled and we have yet to have a snowfall that meant sledding seemed like a good idea. That makes me sad because I think the kids have pretty much all outgrown sledding at this point and we've lived out here for five years. So, I think that's the thing I've noticed most about the weather changing, is the winters just don't seem nearly as harsh or as snowy as they used to.

Interviewer:What animals do you see here in Monroe County?

Vic Strife: We've definitely seen a lot of coyotes. I have seen some. The funny thing is that I used to see them when we lived in town and then we moved out to the country and I hardly ever see them anymore. Now I see a lot more deer. I see a lot of Turkey vultures out here in the culture... out here in the country, rather. Sometimes I see rabbits. I see 'possum, a lot of birds, cardinals and sometimes robins and very occasionally, I see what I'm pretty sure is a golden eagle. I know there are bald eagles out at the lake, but I don't think I've personally seen one in the feather. I've seen them in the newspaper. What else? Lots of bugs. I think we get more bugs now in the summer than we used to probably because we aren't getting those deep freezes.

Interviewer: What did you used to do here?

Vic Strife: Well, what.. Honestly, the changes that I've made have mostly come from not Bloomington or the weather, but having kids. So I used to... Well, I learned to knit here when my youngest child was imminent and that was in 2004. Yeah, you're going to have to edit this one out. It's just not a good question for me, I'm sorry.

Interviewer: What do you miss about how Bloomington used to be?

Vic Strife: I do miss the snow that we used to get and I miss those... I miss the... Sometimes when it's really cold outside you just want to curl up with your family inside your house and be cozy, and I kind of miss that part of winter sometimes, only a little, but sometimes I do.

Interviewer: What do you prefer about how Monroe County is now?

Vic Strife: One of the things I like the very, very most about Bloomington and Monroe County is how active people here are in community, and the longer I live here, the more I find ways that people are doing that, that I can be a part of. It was eight or 10 years ago, probably, that I discovered mending day and discourteous in the library and then it was about five years ago that I discovered that our family would enjoy an offshoot of that, which is the trash and fashion show. I really enjoy getting involved in some of the things that people do here. Like those with blooming labs that are all community volunteer driven things that people who live here look around and say, "I've got an idea and I think I'll see if I can make it a reality." That I think is the best part of this town.

Interviewer: Thank you for your time.

Vic Strife:You're welcome.
