Interviewer: All right. So where do you currently live? 

Interviewee: I live in Hillside, New Jersey. 

Interviewer: And what year did you first like start to live there? 

Interviewee: We moved to Hillside in February 1975. 

Interviewer: February 1975. How would you describe the area when you first moved there? 

Interviewee: It's quiet. 

Interviewer: Very quiet. 

Interviewee: It's quiet. I think there were only, I think, one, two, three houses that had kids.

Interviewer: So a lot of older families at the time? 

Interviewee: I guess you would say we were about the same age. We had kids. I knew the kids before I knew the parents because we had a snow storm. And I was out there shoveling snow, didn't know what I was doing, and the kids came along and they helped me. So I met the kids before I met their parents. 

Interviewer: That's good. And then other than the people, how would you describe the environment? Like, as far as like were there are a lot of buildings, businesses, trees?

Interviewee: These were private homes. 

Interviewer: So only private homes in the area? 

Interviewee: Yes. 

Interviewer: How about parks? Were there a lot, a lot of nature, like, are there any major differences? 

Interviewee: We had one little park, it was a little triangle. It divided my street from the next street. It was just a little triangle park where we walked the dogs. 

Interviewer: And now what has happened to the triangle park now? Or is it still there? 

Interviewee: It's still the same. In fact, it's even better because now, you know, flowers are planted, the trees are still growing nicely. So it's really good, it's really good. And the neighborhood is fantastic, there's lot of kids in the neighborhood except for one house. 

Interviewer: Gotcha. All right, so you will say that the major differences now is it's a lot more beautiful now, you say. So it's more flowers and more trees, more nature, green stuff going on. 

Interviewee: It's green. Yes, you can say that. 

Interviewer: So a lot of green.

Interviewee: Mm-hmm.

Interviewer: Would this be your reason for staying in Hillside, New Jersey for all these years? Why would you say the reason you really stay? 

Interviewee: It's home. I have been to a lot of places, a lot of states but when you come home, it feels really good. You say, "Hey, this is home." 

Interviewer: So did you feel like this was home in February 1975 or did it take time for you? 

Interviewee: No, when I put my foot, over the threshold he said, home. 

Interviewer: So as soon as you stepped there, all right. But if you could bring back something from the first time that you moved to Hillside into today's time, what would it be? 

Interviewee: I don't know, that's a good question, I've never thought about it. 

Interviewer: No, sure. 

Interviewee: You know that's a good question. John [SP], that's a very good question. It's something I'll think about.

Interviewer: You'll come back to that one?

Interviewee: Yes, let's come back to that one.

Interviewer: All right, we'll come back to that one. All right, next question. Have you ever grown plants in like your back yard or in the front or anything? 

Interviewee: Yes. 

Interviewer: You did, all right. And what type of plants have you grown? 

Interviewee: I've grown a vegetable garden. I've had planted flowers all around. 
 
Interviewer: And do you still plant till this day like now? 

Interviewee: I try but I'm physically unable at this moment. 

Interviewer: Gotcha. Physically unable at this moment. 

Interviewee: Yes, [inaudible 00:04:45] to get back out there. As soon as I get my legs together and my back together.

Interviewer: You'll be right back very soon.

Interviewee: Yes, thank you.

Interviewer: But other than your physical limitations, is there any be...like any significant difference in like the soil or the climate or anything like that that has been affecting the way you plant your stuff? 

Interviewer: Yes, my grass has died, for what reason, I don't know. But I intend to hire somebody to let me know what went on and how it went on and hopefully get it back together to where it was. 

Interviewee: All right. We could go back to the final question, if you found the answer to that, if you could bring back something from the first time that you moved to Hillside, what would that be? It could be anything like as far as like the environment, block parties, the people.

Interviewee: You know what, well, when the kids were growing up around our block, we always had a party, like for instance, let's say for Halloween, instead of the kids going out trick or treating, we would give a party, we would give a party. They were never out there going out, you know, by themselves trick or treating. We always had a little party or something. Something was always going on for the kids. And I'll give you another example, too. When there was a party outside of the neighborhood, one of the parents in the neighborhood would take if I wasn't available to take the kids to the party, another neighbor would do also. It was just a very close-knit neighborhood. 

Interviewer: You guys worked as a community more back then? 

Interviewee: Yes. Now all the kids now have grown and they have kids of their own. 

Interviewer: Yup. All right. 

Interviewee: In fact, your mom was included. 

Interviewer: Oh, really?

Interviewee: Yes. 

Interviewer: That was me. 

Interviewee: Yes, indeed. 

Interviewee: All right. Thank you.
