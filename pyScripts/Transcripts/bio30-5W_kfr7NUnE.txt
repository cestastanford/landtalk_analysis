Interviewer: What's your name?

Nancy: My name is Nancy England.

Interviewer: What is the name of this location?

Nancy: I'm going to be talking about Rapid City, South Dakota.

Interviewer: How did this place look before?

Nancy: It is more of a rural town, small town feel, very nice, very friendly people. We just really enjoyed it. Has lots of wildlife.

Interviewer: How has it changed?

Nancy: Over the past 25 years, it's definitely built up with commercial activities, specifically, tourist attractions built around Mount Rushmore which is in the area. I'd say there has been, especially in the last 5 or 10 years, a revitalization of the downtown area, a lot of more shops opening. They have something with 15 Presidents, so 1 President on each corner there they have a statue of, which is interesting history. There is more money going into it which has resulted in rising home prices also. I have noticed in our hikes and stuff that perhaps some less wildlife, less deer and some of the mountain goats are in the area.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you used to do here?

Nancy: Again, the focus has always been on the outdoors. We used to do a lot of hiking, drives through the hills, boating, really enjoyed the outdoors there.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you do here now?

Nancy: There's been a change of focus over the last 25 years. We did come first as a couple and then with young kids, so again like the outdoors stuff. Now the kids are grown so we go out and we help more with elderly parents and everything, but we still try to get outside once in a while. It's just shifting priorities.

Interviewer: Awesome, thanks.

Nancy: You're very welcome.
