Interviewer: Hi, we are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. [inaudible 00:00:06], what did [inaudible 00:00:08] look like in the past? 

Interviewee: Well Las Lomitas was really tiny before. We only had 19 teachers when I started teaching, and now we have over 37 classroom teachers. Mrs. Nettles' room, Mrs. Peterson's room, and Mrs. Gordon's old classroom weren't there before. They were empty spaces. The library wasn't here. The computer lab wasn't here. All these buildings behind us were new. Cano [SP] Hall was the same. Trying to think. Kindergarten playground was the same. We didn't have all that fancy playground equipment before. We had a nice playground, but not that fancy. 

Interviewer: What was Menlo Park Library like in the past? 

Interviewee: I honestly don't know. I never used the Menlo Park Library because I didn't leave here. I used the Mountain View Library. But my guess is, it was a great library then but probably smaller, and I know a lot of children use the Menlo Park Library, but the Mountain View Library was gigantic for children's books. 

Interviewer: How has Las Lomitas school changed? 

Interviewee: The Las Lomitas school is a lot bigger now, more children. There's like 600 children here now, when there used to be like 300 children. We had the same space except those portables weren't here, Champions wasn't here. We had a place called CC...actually we had a place called The Lions Den, something like that, and I'm trying to think. The classrooms had chalkboards. They didn't have whiteboards. And we didn't have technology back then. We had an intercom, is when we called the office. We didn't have telephones. 

Interviewer: How has Menlo Park Library changed? 

Interviewee: Well I think I answered that in the same question with how...what was Menlo Park Library like in the past. My guess is...I don't use the Menlo Park Library, but my guess is it's gotten bigger, and probably has a lot of technology and computers in there, instead of we used to use an ink pad and a stamp, and we used to stamp the date on a card, and they used to take the card out of the book. Now they use a bar code. That's my guess. 

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing with us. 

Interviewee: Thank you very much you guys.
