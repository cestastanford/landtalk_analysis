Interviewer: Hi. What can you tell me about the place that has changed? What's the place?

Woman: I grew up in Witikon, in Zurich. And near to my parents' house, there was a lot of fields. I lived on a street which was quite a modern, there were some modern buildings there in that street. But the one end of the street we had the woods, and on the other end it led to the old center of the village. In the old center of the village, I learned in primary school, they had cows walking down the main street, where there's now a co-op. And you could still really tell it used to be a little farming village. It joined Zurich in 1934, so until then it had less than 10,000 inhabitants. And there was a little church up on the hill, and lots of farm houses, roundabouts, and lots fields. In summer, they still have cows there. But it's lost some of its charm in the last 10 years. 

About eight or nine years ago, when I was still living there with my parents, we used to go...no, before that, even, when I was a really little child, we used to go sledging on this big, big field nearby our house in this old part of the town. I think it belonged to a farmer. And it had a reasonable slope, so we could go sledging on it nicely. All the families in Witikon used to go there. So, winter as soon as it snowed, everyone congregated there to go sledging. And in summer, my friends and I would play on the field, play football. Sometimes we'd camp out there at night. It was really nice, kind of villagey feeling, as if you were out in the countryside. 

And when I was about 9 or 10 years old, suddenly these big poles began appearing all over the old part of the village, on all these fields. And we learnt that they'd sold the land to building companies, and these new big building blocks were going to be built on them. So, for a while we still sledged around these poles, because they were up for quite a bit. And eventually, when they started building, we had to find a new place to go sledging, which wasn't easy because there were other fields in the old part of Witikon which could have been used for sledging, but they too got built up after the years.

And now, these fields, they don't exist any more. They're these big, modern blocks, and people live there now. Some parts of the field are now their gardens, but they don't have that same characteristic as the proper field did. And yeah, it's a shame as well, because some part of the characteristic of that old villagey feeling has gone lost over the years by building on it. We used to have, I know I can't really talk because we also live in a modern block, but my parents had a wonderful view from their bedroom window into the mountains over this big field. And now they just see these flats. They can't see the mountains anymore. So, it has impacted us in different ways. As a child, it was a place to play and not just for me, as well, for lots of families living in Witikon it really was a spot where everyone knew you could go sledging. 

Interviewer: What's your role now at the place?

Woman: I don't live there anymore. So, I go home to see my parents occasionally. And I often also walk up to my parents' house rather than take the bus, I'll walk through the old part of town because it's still part of the village, because it still has some meaning to me. It's a really nice spot to be. And it feels different. It's not the same. And I felt very sad when they built on these fields, because it was part of my childhood, and there's a sort of nostalgia that I combine with it. 

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Do you have anything else to say?

Woman: No.

Interviewer: Thank you. Perfect.
