Jamya: Hello, my name is Jamya Jones. And I attend [inaudible 00:00:05] school and I'm here with Ms. Smith, who's a teacher in my school. And today is April 26, 2018. So the first question is, how long have you been living in Memphis?

Ms. Smith: For about 30 years.

Jamya: And where did you grow up?

Ms. Smith: I grew up in Indian Hills, a little neighborhood outside of the Westwood area.

Jamya: Okay. Did you move to Memphis?

Ms. Smith: I used to live in Detroit, and so we moved from Detroit back to Memphis when I was about 22 years old.

Jamya: Okay. So what don't you like about Memphis?

Ms. Smith: I think the part that I don't like about Memphis, just a spur of the moment thought, is the racist tensions that still exist here. I feel like we're kind of stuck a little bit. Things happened in Atlanta, but Atlanta has progressed forward very nicely, whereas I think Memphis is still kinda stuck in that racist era.

Jamya: So are you from Atlanta?

Ms. Smith: No.

Jamya: Oh, okay.

Ms. Smith: I'm from Memphis.

Jamya: Oh, you're from Memphis.

Ms. Smith: Mm-hmm.

Jamya: You left Memphis.

Ms. Smith: I left Memphis when I was 14, and moved to Detroit. And I lived in Detroit for about eight years, and then we moved back to Memphis. And I moved back to Memphis to help my mum take care of my grandmother.

Jamya: What is one of the best sightseeing places here in Memphis [inaudible 00:01:38] King?

Ms. Smith: So if I were a tour guide, I would probably take people first to Stax Museum just to hear that history and visit that location. I would also take people to the Civil Rights Museum just to get a history of just what the civil rights movement looked like in Memphis. And I would also take people to Slave Haven on 2nd Street.

Jamya: I've never heard of Slave Haven.

Ms. Smith: Really?

Jamya: Mm-hmm.

Ms. Smith: So, Slave Haven is a location where there is an underground tunnel where during slavery time, slaves would escape through that tunnel and they would kind of be in that location just for safety purposes.

Jamya: So, how has Memphis changed since you came here and now? You came back here and now?

Ms. Smith: Probably, the things that I see that have changed is when I first came back here, I came back to help with my grandmother, but I also came back because I didn't want my son raised in Detroit. And I felt like Memphis would probably be a safer place. But I think gangs are still very prevalent. The violence is still here. The black on black crime is heavy. And so, when I came back here in 1987, it wasn't as heavy as it is now.

Jamya: Okay. What do you like about Memphis? Like the food, I know barbecue is known for Memphis barbecue. Do you like the barbecue? Or is it like the blues music and stuff like that? What do you like about Memphis?

Ms. Smith: Probably neither one of those things.

Jamya: Oh. Okay.

Ms. Smith: Because I don't eat pork, and so barbecue is not something that I'm interested in. I do like the music, the Motown music history that's very rich here.

Jamya: Okay. So, if you were on like a road trip, to another destination but you were to pass through Memphis, how would you describe it like as pleasing to the eye or not so pleasing?

Ms. Smith: I think some neighborhoods are very, very, very pleasing to the eye. Like, I like driving down Riverside, I like that scenery. I like the additions that they've done there. I also like driving through Shelby Farms area down in that area as well. But I don't know of any other areas that's just like that I would see and think, "Oh my gosh, that is just like amazing." I don't get that feeling.

Jamya: What about not so amazing places?

Ms. Smith: Not so amazing places are probably just our neighborhoods that are very impoverish, unclean, just very much so unkempt.

Jamya: Okay. That was the last question. Thank you.

Ms. Smith: You are more than welcome.
