Brittany: My name is Brittany Mason, and I will be interviewing a resident of Mount Rainier, Maryland. Would you like to introduce yourself, or remain anonymous?

Interviewee: I'll remain anonymous.

Brittany: Okay. Is it okay if I ask you a few questions about the history of Mount Rainier?

Interviewee: Yes, go ahead. 

Brittany: Can you describe the way Mount Rainier first looked when you moved here?

Interviewee: Well, when I moved in here there was a lot of like, abandoned homes, houses that were unused. There was a lot of people in and out. Young adults would be doing drugs and all kind of stuff like that. And it was pretty kind of noisy you know, cars running in and out, up and down the streets speeding, you know, those kinds of stuff. You'd be walking and a lot of cars would be coming behind you with loud music, a bunch of young kids and all of that, young adults. So, as I said, back it was kind of a bit... feel unsafe. 

Brittany: So you would describe the atmosphere as being hectic?

Interviewee: Sort of, yeah. 

Brittany: Okay. Can you describe any changes that Mount Rainier went through during your stay here?

Interviewee: Oh yeah. Well, now it's completely different. A lot of the young people that was growing up, they pretty much moved out. I don't see - I think I don't know - but you don't see the same things that you used to see before. You know, people speeding, speeding in and out, driving fast and making noise, and selling the little drugs and all kind of stuff on the corner, and all of that stuff, you don't see that no more. Now, it's completely different. You know, it's more what... It's diverse and more grown up people with really little kids. So, I feel more safe, and it's more quiet. And people seem to be pretty friendly now. So, I think it's good now. I like it now. 

Brittany: So, based off your answers, would you say that the community as a whole is closer together or are they more distant?

Interviewee: I think they are closer together, because most of the neighbors on the street will communicate with you or talk to you, and all of that stuff. 

Brittany: And last question, what are some activities that take part in Mount Rainier?

Interviewee: Well you have Mount Rainier Day. You have what those... what Art and Cultural Center which has all these little programs in the evening. Then you have like, summer camps are there. Rec Center, Mount Rainier rec center. They one time had like a skateboard festival right here on the other street from where I live. So, they've been... I think they've been making a lot of changes for the good. 

Brittany: Would you say any of these changes.
