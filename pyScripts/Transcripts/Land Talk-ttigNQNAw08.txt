Interviewer: Describe to me how Starkville used to look?

Interviewee: Again, in my 20 years, I mean, it was smaller and the University wasn't this big. So a lot of the businesses that have grown and expanded and the development that has occurred. Back then there wasn't as much. So, you know, there are some streets that you go to now, and there's a lot of stuff on them and businesses and things like that. And back then they were just kind of, like, maybe, woods or nothing.

Interviewer: Okay. How has the place changed?

Interviewee: Well, I think mostly the development. The university has gotten a lot bigger than it was when I was a small kid. And as a result, there's just a lot more development that goes with that. You know, the university doesn't have the housing for all the kids. So there's a lot more apartments. There's a lot more people in town that are in school that are eating out. So there's a lot more restaurants, things like that, too. So that's really the biggest difference.

Interviewer: All right. What are some of the things you used to do here?

Interviewee: Well, it's where I grew up. So, I mean, I went to school. As a kid, I just, you know, would play in the neighborhood with other kids. We would play sports. In the summer, we'd play baseball, and we would go fishing and camping and just kind of be a kid.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you do in Starkville now?

Interviewee: Well, now when I get back, I'm going to visit my family. So as a grownup, I just kind of go back and hang out at my parents' house and see my family.
