Interviewer: Hi. So what city are we going to be talking about? 

Interviewee: Bloomington, Indiana.

Interviewer: And how long have you lived in Bloomington?

Interviewee: I was born here in 1970. And I moved away a couple of different times for a few years at a time, and then came back in my junior year or high school. So, that's been since 1988. 

Interviewer: What do you remember from when you grew up here?

Interviewee: Well, one of the main things is we have lots of trains coming through. You had to cross train tracks everywhere you went to get in and out of the city, and it would... Now all those rails to trails are now were the trains used to be. There's a big train... Lots of train tracks crossing country club, where the engineers would get off and on, and there are four or five train tracks through there. And it was always a train stop and it was always keeping traffic tied up. 

Interviewer: What kinds of animals have you seen here, and has that changed over time at all?

Interviewee: When I was younger, you never saw turkeys for sure. And then deer, every now and then you'd see a deer. And now everywhere you go it's like in our own back yard. We have 10 deer at a time running through our backyard. And we have turkeys that live in the fields around our house. 

Interviewer: What kinds of plants or trees where here or are here now? Like how have plants and trees changed?

Interviewee: Other than the emerald ash borer destroying the ash trees, I don't really see much of a difference. 

Interviewer: Okay. 

Interviewee: And dutch...when I was a kid dutch elm came through also and killed a bunch of trees. 

Interviewer: Has the weather or rainfall changed at all, or has it stayed the same?

Interviewee: I think it stayed the same. There were bad storms then, there are bad storms now. I don't think there's any difference. 

Interviewer: What do you miss most about living here 20 years ago?

Interviewee: The town has crept out into the county. There's so much spread and sprawl now. It used to be that you could...when you are south of Dairy Queen where the South Credit Union is now used to be a grocery store and that was it. That was all that was on the south side. And then we moved away, and when we came back a couple of years later, that area was a shopping center where Lucky's is had been build, and a Burger King had been built. They had moved a couple of farm houses from country club over to Roger Street and all that farmland had been built up into what's now like Grease Monkey in that area. 

Interviewer: So you just sort miss it being more of a small town feel. 

Interviewee: Small town, yeah. 

Interviewer: Well, thank you for doing this with me. And that's it.
