Interviewer: So, what area have you known for over 20 years?

Interviewee: It's a few miles, my house in, you know, it's our hometown of Buford, Georgia. We've lived there since 1993. And, when we first moved there, it was pretty rural. And, there a road called Georgia 20 that runs through the heart of Buford and that used to just be a two-lane road. Pretty lightly traveled and, you know, very easy to access multiple highways I-85 and I-985. And, we used to use it a lot. On the flip side there wasn't...because it was...we were way out there in the rural area of Georgia. We had to drive 20 minutes to really get to anywhere whether it was shopping, restaurants, or any other sorts of things. We would drive, you know, 15, 20 minutes just to get to civilization, so to speak. 

Interviewer: So, how has it changed since you've been there?

Interviewee: In the late 90s, the Mall of Georgia was built and it was at the intersection of I-85 and Georgia Route 20 and very close to I-985 as well. At the time, we lived about 2 miles from that Mall of Georgia. We still live in the area but about 5 miles farther north but, I'm sorry, the question was how has it affected me or what the change was?

Interviewer: How it changed since you got there in the 90s?

Interviewee: Right. So, the change itself was simply, yeah, that mall was built and it brought a lot more development to it. So, that was the biggest catalyst but there's been a lot more growth. But the immediate, you know, obvious physical change is there's a huge mall. It's the largest mall in Georgia and, in fact, in the southeast and that caused a lot of infrastructure changes. The highway, I-85, was widened as well as Georgia 20 was, not just widened but rerouted. So, it's instead of a two-lane rural country road, it's at least six lanes or maybe eight right in front of the mall. The old Georgia 20 is actually a separate road but the mall itself is, you know, a much bigger road. Georgia 20 has widened the whole area and so it's increased traffic a good bit but brought a lot of the changes.

Interviewer: For you, personally, what other changes do you have to do because of the infrastructure [inaudible 00:02:24] 

Interviewee: Right, right. So, it's good and bad, right? We realized some benefit from it because we don't, I mentioned earlier, we had to go 20 minutes just to go to a restaurant, or to shop, or anything like that. So, we've got everything because, as I mentioned, it brought a lot of other developments as well, the ancillary, more shopping centers like the Target, and the Walmart, all that stuff close by. So, it's a lot more convenient to us. Even though we moved a few miles farther away because of the traffic that was an immediate impact, we still reap the benefits of it. So, we have a lot more close by and we can benefit from those very easily. 

On the flip side, it has still increased the traffic even more so than the capacity has been expanded to fulfill so I don't really go that way very often. In fact, altering my traffic patterns and as a result, moving a little farther out, we hit the highway up farther north of that mall, of Georgia 20 because we just hardly ever want to use that road anymore because...especially Christmas time but even other times of the year. It's just not worth it. It's too busy. And, unless we're going to the mall or one of those ancillary shopping centers or restaurants, as I said, then we avoid it at all costs. So, it adds a little bit of traffic time and everything like that. We can see the fireworks at the Mall of Georgia. There's a lot of other, you know, smaller benefits like that, but we don't live in rural Georgia anymore. That's for sure.

Interviewer: All right. Thank you.

Interviewee: You're welcome.
