Child: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. Can you describe how Las Lomitas used to look?

Woman: Las Lomitas used to be... Actually, when I first came here it looked exactly the same, except that the trees were not as tall, all of this landscaping was not as beautiful, everything was really tiny and young. And this row of portables was not there. Champions used to be way over in the corner of the lot where the new kindergarten wing is. And aside from that, everything looks just about the same.

Child: How does Las Lomitas look now?

Woman: Can you run in and turn it off, or do you want me to? Go for it.

Child: Oh, no. We gotta start over.

Woman: No, we don't. Keep going.

Child: How does Las Lomitas look now?

Woman: Las Lomitas is big and beautiful, and it's under construction, and it's getting bigger all the time. Now there's bulldozer noises, and pounding, and a lot of dust. Right now it's a construction zone, but it is gonna be really beautiful. You can tell by some of the new things that we've already seen, like the new kindergarten wing is really special. Have you been over there yet?

Children: Yeah. Yes.

Woman: And the new kindergarten playground is special, and this landscaping is special. So, I think the new improvements are gonna make Menlo Park a fantastic school, and much bigger.

Child: Thank you for sharing with us.

Woman: You're welcome.
