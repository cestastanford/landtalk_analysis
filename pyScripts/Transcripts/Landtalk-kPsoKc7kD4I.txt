Danny: Thank you for taking the time to do this interview. Do you wanna just start off with your name and where you've lived?

Lezlie: Sure, my name is Lezlie Bork, and I live in Minnesota on a lake called Lake Minnetonka. It's 16722 Grays Bay Boulevard in Wayzata, Minnesota. And I've been here 20 almost 24 years. I moved here before the kids were born and now they're gone so I've been here a long time. And the lake it's over 14,500 acres, it's a massive lake with multiple bays.

Over time they've been dredging different lakes so that they could channel into Minnetonka. Minnetonka is a lifestyle lake in the sense that you can get on and boat and boat over to a restaurant or boat over to a park. You know, tie up and get off, disembark and go in and enjoy a different little town or a restaurant and then get back on your boat and...

It's a lot of fun, not only in the summer but also in the winters. They've got ice fishing and where people actually drive their cars on to the lake, drill you know, a hole in the ice and sit there and fish all day. People put permanent ice houses on the ice not permanent but permanent for the season and enjoy a whole like a home inside on the lake. They have holes in the bottom of the ice house and they drill down and fish right there but they've got heating and TVs and bars and kitchens and they sleep there too, so.

Danny: Wow, that's pretty cool.

Lezlie: It's kind of exciting.

Danny: So you said 24 years.

Lezlie: Right.

Danny: That you've been in this specific house for.

Lezlie: Yes.

Danny: How did it look before like I guess 24 years ago?

Lezlie: Are you talking about the lake, Danny, or the...

Danny: The lake, yeah, I mean, just I guess just the location. So I guess maybe for you that would... I guess it's kind of how you define it so it could be the lake and the house and the land around it, whatever, yeah.

Lezlie: Yes. So because it is a very exciting lake to be on in Minnesota and one of the great fishing, swimming lifestyle lakes. People love living on this lake and they are always tearing down one house to rebuild and build a bigger better house. And then and people you know, tear it down to update it and rebuild it. And so the biggest, probably the biggest change is probably in the amount of housing that has come on to the lake. We used to look across the lake and have a bank of just trees. There was a one person that owned 20 acres across from us and about 10 years ago that sold, that whole parcel the person that owned it passed away. The parcel sold, they subdivided it and probably added probably 40 houses just on the interior and then on the lakeside there's five more, there's probably six more houses on the lakeside.

So although it's still very beautiful and lovely, it's not what it was. There's just a lot of building encroachment coming onto the properties. A big thing that happened about three years ago is the lake really flooded beyond the dam the area and really flooded out people's homes. And they were saying that it was 100-year flood is what they called it but yet they weren't sure that that was actually going to be the case. Because so many homes and developments had come into the area on the whole lake. Mind you, it extends 20 miles to the west and we are on the far east side. And they had said so many developments had come that there's tons of runoff now, there's much more hardcover than there ever has been. And so we haven't seen it in the last three years, it was only in '14 for about eight weeks, it was spilling over a weir that had been built and they had the dam fully open and it was flooding down the river. So we haven't seen that since 2014, but it would not surprise me if that happened. So that's the biggest thing that has happened is just the development has been extensive, buildings.

Danny: So, 24 years ago was there like a lot of development or was it pretty...

Lezlie: So each little...so every...Minnetonka is huge and as I described before it's got a lot of little bays that have been channeled into the main lake. And that all happened in the '70s, early 70's, late 60's a lot of that. So that was before I was here we came here in '92, yeah, because that would be 25 years...24, 93 yeah, right, before Sky was born. And so there wasn't as much development as there is now.

But mostly I would have to say that people tear down and rebuild and they're building bigger, they're not building smaller, they're building bigger footprint. They have some setbacks with the housing codes but they are definitely pushing those very...you know, pushing all those setbacks. So they can be 50-feet from the lake shore and 30-feet on each side but they can apply to the city and get variances so that they, you know, for "the hardship," so to speak and they can go beyond the setback. So that is I would have to say that the biggest change for me, has been, I would say homes are twice as big as they were when we first...

Danny: Interesting.

Lezlie: ...got here, they're twice at least two and a half to three times the size. So your roof, your driveway, all that hardcover is what's really happening so.

Danny: Yeah, wow, okay, cool. So another question, what are some of the things that you used to do on the lake or I guess 24 years ago?

Lezlie: So yeah, so in the summer, swimming and boating and yeah, you know, mostly swimming and boating which is a little bit different now.

Danny: Is it, okay.

Lezlie: Go ahead.

Danny: Yeah, I was gonna ask well, what are some things you do now like has it changed at all or there are?

Lezlie: Yeah, so a lot of new things have come in you know, paddle boats are a big deal, kayaking. So a lot of the last motorized sports although I have to say we jet ski as well. So we did that. We didn't...we probably have only had our jet skis for 12 years so about half of the time. So the development in personal watercraft has been kind of a big deal. We did do snowmobiling much more so than we used to because we aren't getting the snowfall like we used to and snowmobiling on the ice is really dangerous so it has to be kind of a big snowfall. What else? We used to do more cross-country skiing, we're not doing that so much anymore but just walking on the ice is fun. Yeah, that's it.
