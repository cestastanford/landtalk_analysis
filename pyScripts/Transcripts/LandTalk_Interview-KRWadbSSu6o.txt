Interviewer: Okay, so first question is how did this place look before...or that Guam looked before?

Interviewee: Oh, the island of Guam had more beaches available, more public beaches available. But in the past years there are many private investors who have come in because of the demand for more hotels. So the tourism industry especially with Japan has grown. And so there's a lot of private businesses that have bought up a lot of the waterfront property. And so we have a lot of hotels and then in the far northern and southern end of the island the military bases have occupied some of the beautiful beaches there as well. So it's difficult to get through because it's gated, and you have to have some kind of a pass or given some authority to go through. But also the public just can't go through to enjoy it. Another thing that has changed is also the impact of contact of the Federated States of Micronesia. A lot of a lot of them have migrated to Guam and have had a big impact on the economy, social welfare and also health care. So lot of migration from the Federated States of Micronesia

Interviewer: Okay. So you started answering actually my second question already which was how has this place changed. But is there anything else that you would add to that as to how it has changed from how it use to be like before?

Interviewee: I guess there is an increase in tourism, a lot more westernization with the arrival of some of the businesses, like the food industry, Burger King and just the different restaurants and especially the restaurants. So the types of food that normally the locals have depended upon, their diets have changed.

Interviewer: I see. Okay. And then what are some of the things that you used to do in Guam?

Interviewee: Use to do, used to swim a lot at some of the beaches that are not accessible anymore. Used to hike at some of the places that are not accessible anymore. There are many places that have been overtaken by the military that we just can't access anymore.

Interviewer: So what are some of the things that you do in Guam now?

Interviewee: Well, we still try to find other places to hike to and we do go to the beaches that are open and available. So we still try to do that, but we miss going to the ones that we used to go to.

Interviewer: Right.
