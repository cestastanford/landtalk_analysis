Interviewer: Hi. So today, I will be interviewing my mom about her hometown and how that's changed over time. 

Hi, mom. What is your name and what place will you be talking about today?

Xinying: Hi. My name is Xinying [SP], and I'm talking about Chengdu. It's the capital of the Sichuan province in the southwest part of China.

Interviewer: Awesome. Could you describe what Chengdu looked like when you were growing up?

Xinying: Oh, wow. That's a long time ago. When I was growing up in Chengdu, it was pretty much a agricultural setting…surrounding. I mean, basically, it depends on what we're talking about, if we're talking about downtown Chengdu or talking about the suburb or the countryside, in the countryside around Chengdu. If we're talking about the city itself, it's basically like everywhere else during that period of time, which is 30 years ago. I was around 20, 18 years old, like your age. If we're talking about on the street, there's basically millions of bicycles, and the way in… We rode bicycles everywhere, go to work, go to school, go to places, and shopping. It's like anywhere else. 

Interviewer: Awesome.

Xinying: Not much to do, honestly. 

Interviewer: Yeah. Can…

Xinying: And we'd go to a supermarket. We don't have supermarket at that time. We go to the farmers' market literally every morning, go shopping, shopping the food for whole day, and go back. Kids go to school, and the parents go to work and goes and prepares their meals, go back to…for your meals every day, three meals every day, and then go to do your own stuff. Everything's fresh and there's not much pollution. That's all I remember.

Interviewer: Yeah. Thank you. What are some typical activities that you did while you were young there?

Xinying: Oh, wow. So we did have to go to school. At that time, probably I was in college. When I'm visiting back, during our vacation, we literally just hang around. We have…hanging out with friends in the countryside. And at nighttime, we gather together. We have a group of poets and artists, painters. We hung around, got…drinking teas and basically…all right, have some coffee around that time. And we listened to Western music. And we sometimes would go to dance and basically chat away the times, all right, on…

Interviewer: Yeah. I guess could you go into some detail about what Chengdu looks like now and, I guess, how Chengdu has changed over time, I guess, when now you come back and visit?

Xinying: Wow. It's a huge change. Literally, I cannot find my way home. There's just so much. Absolutely upside down. I mean, in a good way and in good sense and bad sense. In a good way, yes, there's this… It's like all major metropolitan in the U.S., like New York or even Paris, you know. It's a very…very much looks like a developed, in a sense, is that everything's newly built, skyscrapes, and fancy… And there's a highway, and the millions of cars replaced bicycles. They still have bicycles, but it's more like the bicycle is now, it's… What's kind of… You can rent it on the street. You don't need to own a bicycle, but you have this [inaudible 00:05:26]. You can rent a bicycle on the…on any part of a street, you know, in a very cheap… Like when in parks, you can rent them for 10 hours. 

It's really a huge change in China. And the subways and high-speed trains for transportation, which, compared to U.S. one, they are just brand-new. Everything is fast, which I cannot recognize. Everything is brand-new. In the past 30 years, 40 years, China is totally in a new direction. Everyone's holding a smartphone, and people no longer talk to each other. They look at their phone like we're doing here in the U.S. 

And what has really surprised me in China now, it's the internet and AI, I think. Particularly technology has been really taking over by…all parts of China. I mean, even in the countryside. If you go to farmers' market, go buy two, like a 20 cents of green onion, right, with a farmer, you don't have to bring your cash. You just use the cell phone, like a Wi Xing [SP]…WeChat. We use that to scan our little bar code, and then you can pay to the farmer. You don't have to have any… There's no longer…have any cash or currency go through people's hands. We just use our cell phone to do everything. You go to a restaurant, you go to a movie theater, you go to a fashion show, you can do all transactions. You go to even the five-star hotel. You don't have to take your credit card out. Not like in the U.S., right? At least you need to take your credit card. But in China, you just bring your phone, you know, cell phone. It will get everything done in a fast and secure way. So in that case, it's amazing, you know. That's what I have to see. It's totally changed.

Interviewer: So what do you do in Chengdu now when you come back and visit? What are some typical activities?

Xinying: You know, I've been going back at least three or four times every year, literally visiting my parents and my relatives. And now, just…it's so convenient to take Didi, which is Uber in the U.S. So convenient. Just a call, use your phone, and they can get to you, take you everywhere. Very cheap, relatively speaking, and it's safe. It's like that. I'm visiting friends, then go to...shopping and go to…visiting museums, go to concerts. And at nighttime, I go to…visiting bars with my friends, like a coffee shop. 

There's a lot of cultural activities going on in China. Nobody goes to sleep, it seems. Even at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, you can go to any corner of a street. You can find a very nice restaurant which is still open, and people are still chatting and…in a tea house. 

So in that case, there's a lot of activity. But honestly speaking, there's a lot of things I couldn't recognize, but there's a lot of things very familiar. It's like you are shopping in U.S. They have this…all fancy international hotels, restaurants. I've seen like a Starbucks, McDonald's. All those kinds of things is everywhere, in every corner of China in Chengdu. So basically, sometimes I get confused. Am I in Chengdu, my hometown, or am I in New York or in Seattle, Washington? So basically, it's a world village, just a huge change.

Interviewer: Awesome. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this interview with me. Thank you.

Xinying: You're welcome. Thank you.
