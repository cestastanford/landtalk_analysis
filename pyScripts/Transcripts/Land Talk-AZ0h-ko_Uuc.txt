Interviewer: I'm gonna be interviewing my sister Myra [SP] who's lived in Los Angeles for 20 years. Okay, so what do you remember about Los Angeles 20 years ago or a while ago?

Myra: Twenty years ago. I don't remember that far. 

Interviewer: Okay, has it changed in any ways that you remember, any big changes?

Myra: I can't remember from 20 years ago but I can remember changes from since I was in high school.

Interviewer: Okay, what are those changes?

Myra: We used to have a little bit of seasons and now it's a lot hotter. There's less rain, there's less...the winter, our winter isn't very cold anymore.

Interviewer: Any changes in activity or physical space in the area?

Myra: I guess more apartments.

Interviewer: That's it?

Myra: Yep, more places being built for people to live in.

Interviewer: Have there been any changes in the plants around the area or any animals?

Myra: There weren't ever that many plants and animals since it's such an urban area. I think there's probably less plants and trees than ever though.

Interviewer: Do you remember any big storms or natural disasters?

Myra: There's just like a lot of wildfires and now there are happening more often and more intensely and causing more damage.

Interviewer: Do you...oh, yeah, you still live in the area, so is there anything you like about it?

Myra: I guess it's just convenient because it's so close to everywhere else. So there's a lot of stores and there's a lot of places you can visit, there's museums.

Interviewer: So what's your favorite part about living here, would it be what you just said?

Myra: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. So you said the weather changed, is that all you remember, just the seasons?

Myra: Yeah, just that the hot season is just very continuous and it seems like it takes a lot longer for there to be an actual winter or for the temperature to dip down a little. And even though, like right now, November-ish, it should be a little colder, it's still pretty hot when you go outside. There's not much rain anymore.

Interviewer: Okay. Is there anything else that has changed or you think you've said enough?

Myra: I guess I think there's a lot of like more homeless people now.

Interviewer: Do you want to tell me more about that or...?

Myra: Well, I guess it has to do probably not with the climate, maybe more with the opioid epidemic, I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Woman: [foreign language 00:04:54].

Interviewer: Okay, well, I guess that's the end. So thank you for allowing me to interview you.

Myra: You're welcome.

Interviewer: Okay.
