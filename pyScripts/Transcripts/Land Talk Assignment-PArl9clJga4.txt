Brandon: Hi, this is Brandon McGroarty [SP] interviewing my dad, Kevin McGroarty, who has lived in the same home in Fairfax, Virginia, for 23 years. So I'm just gonna ask him some questions about changes in the environment. So, Dad, over the past 23 years living in Fairfax, Virginia, what are some big things you've noticed?

Kevin: The biggest thing we've noticed, obviously, is when little trees become big trees in our yard that we planted. We live in a development which was originally farmland that became a housing development in the mid '80s. We moved in around '92-ish, and the trees and the surrounding area was planted by the homeowners, and we've noticed the changes, and obviously bushes have grown. Actually, bushes have grown and overgrown and had to be removed and replaced. Trees have gone from 4 to 5 feet tall to 15 to 20 feet tall. And in the surrounding areas where we really notice the biggest changes, we were surrounded by woods, basically, all around. We've many parks in Virginia, and we were surrounded by parkland basically. But over the years, obviously, we have office buildings now that are close, we have other developments that are close. And it's really, you know, they've cut down most of the surrounding areas around us, and that's affected a lot of what we see.

Brandon: So just going off of that, so the plant abundance in the area, can you just go a little bit into detail about how that specifically changed around the house and then also just in Fairfax County? I know you kind of said that with cutting down a lot of trees that's made some big changes, but what are like some specific changes you've seen in the plants around where we live?

Kevin: Well, we see a lot of new plants actually. So we don't see a lot of old growth anymore. We'll see plants that are put in by landscapers that are smaller, we see a lot of small trees, but really, they're all the same types of trees. Developers will put in dogwood trees a lot, and it's nice looking, but it also looks like a brand new development because a lot of the big trees are disappearing.
 
Brandon: Okay. Have you noticed that this change in plant population has had...what kind of effect do you think it's had on like the animal life in the area with what you guys see and stuff?

Kevin: Okay. So, because of...believe it or not, you probably think that we wouldn't see a lot of animals, but we see a lot more now. We have deer that come right up to the backyard and they eat the plants that we put in. We have squirrels everywhere, they're looking for trees to nest in. We've seen, over the last four or five years, we've seen a lot of fox. Lots of people in our neighborhood have seen coyotes every once in a while by their homes. So it hasn't been a disappearing of animals, it seems like the animals have no place to go but to come live in our house.

Brandon: Awesome. And other than plants and animals, have you seen any big changes in the weather in Fairfax, Virginia, over the past 23 years?

Kevin: Well, it's definitely...the weather changes a lot. In the winter we've had winters where we have two feet of snow at times. We've had winters to where it was 40, 50 degrees a lot. And not only does it vary, but it can vary week by week. So I feel like since climate is weather over time, I feel like the climate itself is changing a little bit. When we first moved in here, it was fairly standard. Your cold winters, your snow days, no school those days, lots of sledding. And then, you know, your summers were warm and hot. But now, it was a couple of weeks ago we were 60 degrees. Couple of weeks before that it was five degrees.

Brandon: Yeah, awesome. Thanks, Dad.

Kevin: Hey, no problem, Brandon.
