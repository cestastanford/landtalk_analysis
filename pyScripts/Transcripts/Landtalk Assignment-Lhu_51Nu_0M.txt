Derrick: Okay. Hi, I'm Derrick Chang. I was born in Los Angeles in 1965. I've lived almost exclusively in Los Angeles since 1974.

Interviewer: So, first question, how did this place look before?

Derrick: Well, just in Downtown L.A. in general, the part around the Convention Center, especially, it was just pretty vacant. There was just mostly parking lots and small apartment buildings, mostly lower income. A lot of homeless people. There were...there was not much to do down on there. There was office buildings in the northern part of Downtown, but, south of Seventh Street there was pretty much nothing except the Convention Center, and just some small apartments and abandoned buildings around there.

Interviewer: How has it changed now?

Derrick: Well, now, there's just a ton of development. There's The Metro Rail running straight through Downtown, straight south on Downtown right through the middle. There's of course Staples Center, the arena, and then from around there, because of that, there's L.A. Live, which is a big retail and shopping and food area. There's The Ritz-Carlton, the Marriott. There's a lot more hotels being built there and there's a lot of residences being built, big apartment buildings, luxury apartment buildings, all sorts of studio spaces, that sort of thing.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you used to do there in Downtown L.A.?

Derrick: Well Downtown L.A., when I was growing up, there wasn't much to do. People worked there on the north part of Downtown where the office buildings were. The southern part, towards that, there was the Convention Center, that's the only place people went. For us, the only reason we went to the Convention Center every year was for the auto show, in January every year, that was pretty much the only reason we ever went to the Convention Center, or that part of Downtown in general. And then later when The L.A. Marathon started we would go down there. People that ran the marathon, like I did once in a while, we would go down there to get our information packets and our numbers and all that, and that was pretty much the only time we would go that part of the city. That was not a place where any anybody did anything after work. There was no restaurants really open down there late at night, or at night-time at all. It was just strictly daytime office buildings in the north part of Downtown and everything's shut down by 6:00 or 7:00.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you do here now?

Derrick: Well, now, there's the...because The Staples Center and there's...and the whole L.A. Live with the Microsoft Theater is where the concerts are, there's Lakers, Kings, Clippers, all sorts of sporting events. There's concerts down there. And then a lot of people like to go to L.A. Live as a thing to do, even a touristy thing to do in L.A. There's all kinds of shopping now. There's even people...people live there, I don't, but we, you know, there's a lot of people that live there now, young professionals, they've opened up grocery stores because there's a need for that now. There was never a grocery store there when I was young. And there's, I mean, there's a lot of hotels. And so, people are down there all the time, like many of my friends have season tickets at Staples Center, so we go down there for all kinds of sporting events, concerts, all sorts of things. There's lots of places to eat down there before the game and after the game even. So there's just a ton to do there now.

Interviewer: Even volleyball tournaments at the Convention Center.

Derrick: There's...yes there's volleyball tournaments at the Convention Center.

Interviewer: Or Chainsmokers concerts.

Derrick: Yes. All sorts of concerts at the Microsoft Theater which is a small venue, at Staples which is a large venue, and at the Convention Center which is like, a, I guess, like a huge dance hall type of place.

Interviewer: Well, can't wait to look at it next time, you. Thank you.

Derrick: You're welcome.
