Ann: Hi, I'm Ann and I'm 54 years old. I live in Highland Park which is a suburb of Dallas, Texas. It's somewhat of an urban suburb in that we're very close to the downtown area, and it's one of the older suburbs in Dallas. And we live very close to a creek right off of a very busy street. Many of the homes were built in the 20s, 30, and 40s. Our home was built in 1960 and did I say I've been in the same house for 24 years now actually.

Matt: And so what we're talking about our front yard which you can see here. And a little bit about the surrounding area, which as my mom said, we've spent the last 20 years at. And so the first question, mom, is how did this place look before right when you got here 20 years ago?

Ann: Well, when I got here 20 years ago many of the houses were the old. What had originally been designed for the street and for the neighborhood. All the parks were the same, there hadn't been a lot of new construction. And in the last 20 years, I'd say about half the houses in our neighborhood have been torn down and there's been new construction put in their place. And one of the things that I found surprising about 10 years ago, I thought this would slow down as we had a little bit of a recession. And I think people started to become more aware of global warming and abusing of resources. But what I see today is that they're building through the edges of their lots, their homes are bulging like big. They're digging down for maybe six-car garages, they're building three stories up, homes are often 10,000, 15,000, even 20,000 square feet. 

Our weather here in Dallas is pretty severe, but it changes rapidly. For example today we had a huge rainstorm and then the sun came out and everything dried up. So in the winter we often have ice storms that can last a couple days, we often get a day or two of snow, but it doesn't usually stay. We get severe hailstorms with just the biggest hail you've ever seen, golf ball size, that damages cars, breaks trees, kind of causes all kinds of chaos. We did have a drought the last few years, but that's gone and I notice that my neighbors really don't pay attention to the drought. We all have green lawns and beautiful trees, there's not a real interest in planting drought-tolerant plants at this point. As I said earlier we live near a creek and you can see the levels of the creek really change. They flood, we're near a flood plain and we have to be careful about that. And then they get down to where they're sort of dried up. So that's pretty severe.

Another thing is how that affects the animals in the area. And 20 years ago we would never have seen a coyote come up and be looking for food in our neighborhood. And of course, that makes everybody in a panic about small dogs and cats. But around 5.00 am, 6.00 am we've had a bunch of coyote sightings. And I think as animals learn to adapt with humans and us building more and kind of moving them out of their habitat, they're figuring out how to live in the city and we're seeing a lot more of them. My other son Michael and I have recently seen armadillos which we never saw those. One was crushed, one was alive. We have raccoons, we have squirrels, and rats and mice and you see them often.

Recently we've had a couple of hawks in our neighborhoods eating squirrels. We have owls, we also have lots of ducks, and geese, and Canadian geese. We have egrets, and we have hummingbirds, and we have jays, and lots of birds are here. And it's really fun to watch them and that really hasn't changed the predatory animals more than just the birds.

Another thing that I've noticed that's different here is the reaction to mosquitoes. So when I first moved here I would often go to the park with my kids and just sort of let the mosquitoes bite me. But now we have a severe West Nile threat here in Dallas. And so we have citywide spraying, people are told to avoid dusk in the parks and down by the creeks. And you know, we actually did have a neighbor behind us pass away from West Nile, but he was an elderly gentleman. So I think there's a lot more concern about mosquitoes. And I'm trying to think what else is really the same? Oh, I know one, our streets. Our streets seem to be under a constant barrage of the weather and elements and the cracking, and the big holes that are created. We have everywhere you go in Dallas right now you have the streets being worked on because the weather has been so severe. And I don't really remember that being such an issue 20 years ago. I also noticed that our house, behind us, we're constantly fixing wood and painting things and the maintenance is pretty consistent on that due to water erosion. Matt, any other questions for me that you can think of?

Matt: What are some of the things you use to do here 20 years ago? And what are some things you do now around the area?

Ann: Well, 20 years ago we actually didn't have the same kind of facilities we have now. We had parks, we had all kinds of great things. But Dallas has been really revitalized and we have an incredible Performing Arts Center now. We have a new pro-science museum. We actually used to go to Fair Park, which is in South Dallas and that has not been restored. And in the last 20 years, it's kind of been on the decline and I'm hoping that that gets restored because it's a beautiful piece of land with all kinds of history. We have the new George Bush Library over by SMU. So Dallas has changed and really grown, but as far as our economy and ecology I think we're not as an aware community as some communities. I think we still use up a lot of resources in summer, summer feels a little bit hotter to me now than it used to. It is so hot here and then everywhere you go people are just blasting their air conditioning. And I just feel like when I go into a store or a restaurant that if they just turn it down a few degrees I'd be more comfortable, and their bills would be less. And maybe it would help with not using up quite so many resources. So I do notice that more and more that the air conditioning needs to go.

And then also when we watch on our streets, so there's about 16 houses just on our block. And of the 16 three are brand new and almost all of them have been remodeled. Again the green lawns are still in place so, I think it's pretty but it's probably not very practical. And we have a zoo in town, a beautiful zoo. And that has been completely restored and redone. And we're also near Fort Worth which is kind of a fun getaway. They also have a thriving art scene and a cowboy scene that's sort of where the Cowboys are when you're in Dallas, Fort Worth, it's over at Fort Worth. Anything else you can think of?

Matt: No. That's good. Thanks so much, mom.
