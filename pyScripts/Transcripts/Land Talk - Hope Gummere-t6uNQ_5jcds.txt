Hope Gummere: Hi, my name is Hope Gummere and I will be interviewing my mom about the changes of the land around the Bloomington area.

Angie Gummere: Hi, I'm Angie Gummere and we have been living in this housing edition around here for about 20 years. So I will be talking about the changes that have happened around our home.

Hope Gummere: Awesome. So for the first question, what do you remember from when you first moved here?

Angie Gummere: There were hardly any houses behind us. It was all... The land was newly developed and you could see from our house all the way to the golf course. And there was...yeah, there were no houses and it was lots of dirt.

Hope Gummere: Yeah, not very developed.

Angie Gummere: No.

Hope Gummere: So what has been the biggest change in your physical surroundings that you've noticed in the past 20 years?

Angie Gummere: Lots of houses. A lot of homes now. I think it's probably around 400 homes in our edition and we were one of the first ones here when we first moved in. So, that is what I have noticed. A lot more grass as the homes have gone up. Yeah, I would say that's more people, more kids, those kinds of things.

Hope Gummere: And what is your favorite part about living here?

Angie Gummere: Well, I love its proximity to the Clear Creek Trail. It's very close to the trail and we have used that a lot over the years, especially walked with you kids. We've taken tricycles on the trail. We've ridden bikes on the trail, roller skated on the...roller bladed on the trail, yeah.

Hope Gummere: Have you noticed anything about like the types of vegetation or the animal or, yeah, just life around the trail that has kind of changed since the housing edition?

Angie Gummere: Yes, when we first moved in, it was basically all farm lands that surrounded it. There were horses and cows. And at one point we had camels that were on the trail, a couple of camels. So that was fun to take your kids down to see the camels when they were here. And those have since gone and it's been more housing that's built up.

Hope Gummere: Yeah, so less farm animals, more development.

Angie Gummere: Yes.

Hope Gummere: For sure. And have there been any big storms that you remember in the last 20 years?

Angie Gummere: I don't know that our.. There have been storms. We did have one where a branch threw our window in our bedroom. The biggest one I remember is a few years ago but that was on the West side of talent. A tornado came through by, it was 45 and over there by the fairgrounds. That's probably the biggest one I remember.

Hope Gummere: But it didn't really affect our house necessarily but just the area, I'm pretty sure.

Angie Gummere: I will say we have lots of Bradford pairs that the developers put up and they don't last well in hard storms, and so they have... It's caused a lot of those to go down over the years in our development. Lots of strong winds will do that.

Hope Gummere: Yeah, and what do you miss most about living here within the last 20 years?

Angie Gummere: Well, I think lots of houses have been good and bad, and it was nice to have a little more space. But at the same time, the new housing has brought in a lot of great neighbors for us. Some of your closest friends growing up were a house across the backyard. And so the people that the houses have brought have been good but at the same time it's taken a little of the space, so. But the neighbors have been at great trade off for that.

Hope Gummere: Would you say that there's more vegetation around like trees or just like flowers since there have been more developments?

Angie Gummere: Yes, I would say for sure. There's definitely more than when we moved in. This is, the houses have gone up and the yards have been, you know...

Hope Gummere: Landscaping.

Angie Gummere: Landscaping and more trees have been planted, and yes.

Hope Gummere: Awesome, and what do you like most about living here now?

Angie Gummere: I like the proximity to the city. It's kind of... It's not directly in town but it's close. We're close to about anything we want to do. It's close to the trail. It's close to the Beeline Trail, which we have loved when we've ridden bikes down to the farmer's market. So I think that's what I love most about it. It's a great location as far as you don't feel like you're in the main city, but you're also close to everything you want to do.

Hope Gummere: Yeah, that's awesome. All right, well, thank you for being my interviewee for the day.

Angie Gummere: My pleasure.

Hope Gummere: Awesome.
