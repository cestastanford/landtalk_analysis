Ken: Hi, my name is Ken Jaffe and I've lived in the Saint Clemente area for over 20 years.

Interviewer: So, how did San Clemente look before, or, like, when you first came to the area?

Ken: San Clemente used to have considerably more open space. And now it feels like every open space has been filled with either a home or a business.

Interviewer: And how has it changed since you've lived in the area?

Ken: Well, in addition to all the development near the beach, last year they built a huge outlet mall that attracts considerably more people to Saint Clemente.

Interviewer: And so what are some of the things you used to do in the Saint Clemente area, and what are some of the things you do now?

Ken: The same things that made Saint Clemente special are still available like fishing and swimming in the ocean. It just feels more crowded now when you do them. There also more things to do like shopping and new restaurant choices that make Saint Clemente even better.
