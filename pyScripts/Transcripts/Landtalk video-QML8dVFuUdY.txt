Interviewer: Okay. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit how the place looked before?

Interviewee: Sure. When we first moved in the north border...on the north border there were, like, six weed trees, mulberry trees that were, like, dropping all these awful blueberries, kind of, all over the yard. And they were really...other than that, there was like tiger lilies and, like, very few plantains, big kind of ugly shrubs against the garage. And the rest of it, just all grass. There was a basketball hoop back there that was in a little bit of disrepair. And, yeah, I guess...

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: That's all for how it looked originally. Oh, there was that chain link fence also running on both sides of the property.

Interviewer: On the north and south sides, right? Yeah?

Interviewee: Both the north and the south side, originally.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. And then...

Interviewee: But now it still runs along the south side of the property.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. And so, can you tell me how the backyard has changed?

Interviewee: Yeah. So then about a few years after we moved in, we were very good friends with our neighbors and so we decided to take down the chain link fence [inaudible 00:01:56] in our home from our neighbor's backyard to make the space more shared and communal between the two families. So we took on the chain link fence, took down the weed trees that were in between, planted a lot of flowers with an emphasis on, like, native species in between our house and theirs to make a garden. And then there's two pathways in that backyard, along the northern border of the property that you...like stone pathways, I guess, connecting their yard with ours.

Interviewer: How did you learn about what plants were native to the area?

Interviewee: [inaudible 00:02:56] mostly from...we bought most of the plants that we planted back there from the farmers market, right. And also for a while, early on in living at this property, had participated in, like, the neighborhood garden club. A lot of the people in the garden club are...like we'd share plants with one another and they were into...a lot of people in the club were into promoting these native species.

Interviewer: And then, at the farmers market, they would also, like, tell you at the farmers market that they were native species, or...?

Interviewee: Yeah, again. Like that's [crosstalk 00:03:45]

Interviewer: Maybe someone from the area?

Interviewee: Yes. I mean, yes. Some of the sellers were all about, like, you know, building butterfly gardens or, like, yeah. Again, like, the promotion of native species by some of the, like, vendors, the sellers at the farmer's market would be promoting that, like, return to the prairie flowers.

Interviewer: Sure, sure. Okay. Thank you. Can you tell me about what are some of the things or activities that you used to do in the back yard? And then about, what are some of the things that you do now?

Interviewee: Sure. So, actually when...early in the backyard, the kids who were playing in the backyard where smaller, so there's some riding of bicycles and tricycles, those Cozy...you know, the Cozy Coupes. You know what a Cozy Coupes is?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: Like the little...

Interviewer: Plastic things?

Interviewee: ...kind of plastic cars that the kids climb into. A lot of that. We would...people would connect them together and, like, to form, like, trains to ride along the back sidewalk, and also the use of these where the basketball hoops is to ride on. A lot of sidewalk chalk, a lot of hide and seek, and... So gardening is a thing that we've done and kind of re-landscaping and gardening. We have done that every spring, summer, and fall that we've...for the past 20 years.

Interviewer: We also used to do the fire pit, right? We don't really do that anymore, do we?

Interviewee: Yeah. Let's see. I don't know how many years ago...like, that probably wasn't right away. That was probably somewhere in the middle that we used it the most. Now, it feels like we pull it out for the...

Interviewer: Right. It was like a portable fire pit.

Interviewee: ...Halloween party.

Interviewer: Oh. So you do it for the Halloween party still.

Interviewee: Yeah, but probably not as much. We still use it for the Halloween party once a year.

Interviewer: But it kind of kills the grass underneath, right?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Sometimes? Didn't that use to happen?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: That there would be like a big, dry patch underneath if we used it too much?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Lovely.

Interviewee: Yeah, lovely. So let's see. So we have the swing set. Jessie loved to swing, would swing for hours when she was little. So the swings site got...used to get more use. It's still back there. We have to plan to remove it maybe this summer or next summer so...because it has only occasional visitors who use the swing set now. The basketball court we repaved maybe...I don't know...six years ago? And that gets a ton of use now. It's being used now more than ever...

Interviewer: Especially as the kids get older...

Interviewee: ...with the teenage boys.

Interviewer: Yeah, more interesting than the sidewalk chalk.

Interviewee: What's that?

Interviewer: As the kids get older that's more interesting to them than the sidewalk chalk, right?

Interviewee: Yes. Than the sidewalk, yeah. But, you know, I mean, you know when we were little we...I don't know...we played some...and then I guess when Patrick was there, we played some like baseball, running on bases, but I don't know. Now, If they run bases they do it next door over the next door neighbor's yard because, like, as they've...as everybody's gotten bigger there's more base cover and then their yard is bigger.

Interviewer: Right, because the yard to the north that's now connected doesn't have the swing set. And because they don't have the front.

Interviewee: Right.

Interviewer: Their house doesn't extend as far back, right? So just the plain, green space is just bigger, right?

Interviewee: Right, their rear, like, open grass space is probably twice the size of our yard. So that's the space that's...that's not, you know, that shared space...the space was now shared. Like, soccer and football and baseball, like, that's played by my family is technically on their property.

Interviewer: Right.

Interviewee:  So, we really kind of think of it all as... 

Interviewer: Ours.

Interviewee: ...our backyard.

Interviewer: Right, right. And we also...

Interviewee: So much so that we keep breaking their windows and didn't care to replace them.

Interviewer: And we also do some gardening in their yard also, right?

Interviewee: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

Interviewer: I guess not. Yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah. Probably plant...I don't know, I think, like, we plant, probably, I don't know. There's a patch back there that's probably, I don't know, maybe 5 feet wide by 8 to 10 feet long, I would guess, that we do all the planting and gardening.

Interviewer: Yes. So what kinds of things...?

Interviewee: And then the produce is shared.

Interviewer: What kinds of things do you plant in the garden?

Interviewee: I mean, that part is all the, well, vegetables or, mostly tomatoes, but, you know, some variety. Well, salsa garden, right? So you've got to plant some jalapenos, sometimes some cilantro, or cucumbers we've done back there.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. And then so [crosstalk 00:10:07] that's mostly people...members of our family doing the planting, but then we share the produce with our neighbors.

Interviewee: Right. We do all the planting and all the weeding. They lend occasional watering and a fair amount of harvesting.

Interviewer: A fair amount of harvesting.

Interviewee: Maybe a lot of harvesting, right.

Interviewer: Okay, great.

Interviewee: Especially their 7-year-old.

Interviewer: Especially the 7-year-old.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Is there anything else that you think you wanna share about the backyard before we go?

Interviewee: Yeah, looking at it again. I would say, like, we have done some things to, like...I don't know. We've added some earth back there, or like, garage art, a couple of things that I painted, and a couple of things that we inherited [inaudible 00:11:12] my mother in law that we got after she passed. And then, I don't know...did you do wanna mention that we have plans to make big changes to the backyard this summer by building a deck? Oh, I should have mentioned the grill because, you know, we do a lot of...

Interviewer: Grilling.

Interviewee: ...outdoor cooking. Yeah, outdoor grilling.

Interviewer: And that's on the...?

Interviewee: Right now, we just have a very small patio space with some chairs, but...

Interviewer: That's cement, like a cement patio. Like a sidewalk, right? Like, normal cement patio.

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. You can't really call it a patio, yeah.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: It's an extended sidewalk.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: But in spite of its size we still have lots of people coming over to hang out there, eat there, talk, get on the steps despite the inadequate seating, so we have a plan to build a deck.

Interviewer: Yeah. This summer, right?

Interviewee: Yes, this summer. 

Interviewer: And can you just mention briefly some of the choices that are going into, like, what the deck would look like and then also, like, who you're hiring to build the deck?

Interviewee: Sure. So the work around the home, including this deck, we seek to hire minority-owned businesses. So we hired a black architect to design the space for us. We want it to have some kind of, maybe two levels and some kind of space so it flows into the yard so that when we're grilling or doing other things, hanging out in the yard, it's kind of its integrated. And then we have a couple of names of black contractors that we'll use to [inaudible 00:13:35] for building the deck. And what else do you...? Is there something else you wanted to know?

Interviewer: No. I think that was it. And then the deck will mostly, I think, will be used for, like, having people over more, right? And then just as having space to be outside also.

Interviewee: Yes. And the next-door neighbors who we share the yard with are super excited.

Interviewer:  Very excited about the deck.

Interviewee: He talked to Mike about this the other day. He's like, "I heard about your deck plans." So they're so into it. So that will be fun.

Interviewer: Great. All right. Well, thank you so much for talking to me about the backyard. I really appreciate your time.

Interviewee: You're more than welcome.
