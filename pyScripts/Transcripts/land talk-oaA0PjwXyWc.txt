Linda Simington: Hi. My name is Linda Simington. I live in Shelton, Washington. I moved here in 1979. Lived here through 1982 and then moved back here in 1992 and have been here ever since.  

Female interviewer: Awesome. Okay. So how did this place look before, when you first lived in Shelton? 

Linda Simington: Shelton was busy downtown, log trucks, mill going at the end of the street. We had a J.C. Penney's, a Radio Shack, and you did all your 
shopping downtown. 

Female Interviewer: Okay. And how has it changed since then? 

Linda Simington: Well, there are very few logging trucks. The mill shut down. The stores that I used to shop at in the downtown shopping area have gone 
away. Downtown is probably primarily some restaurants and thrift stores for the most part. There is a grocery store downtown. Otherwise, everything has 
moved up on the upper side of our town, which we refer to as the Mountain View area. Walmart came in, probably in the early 90's, which had a big impact 
on the whole downtown retail business. A lot of them shut down after the Walmart moved in. And since then, other businesses have taken root up in that 
Mountain View area as well. 

Female Interviewer: Okay. What are some of the things you used to do here when you first lived in Shelton? 

Linda Simington: We went bowling at the bowling alley. The bowling alley is gone now. It burnt down. Of course I was going to high school here so I played 
the same sports that the kids that are in high school still do. So that hasn't changed. We did a lot of outside things. Going to the local lakes and rivers for fun 
in the summertime, and then travelling not far to go to the beaches and enjoy that area as well.

Female Interviewer: Awesome. And what are the things you do here now?

Linda Simington: Well, I'm kind of a homebody,of sorts. I don't do a lot other than in town working part-time, going to the grocery store, that type of thing. 
There's not a lot of other activities, other than some small local restaurants to enjoy. I do enjoy the thrift shops now and then. But other than that I am usually 
heading to the bigger town, Olympia, in my case, for more options for shopping and entertainment. We don't...we've got one move theater in town in 
Shelton. It's been there probably the whole time since my early years living here. I have enjoyed that, you know, a number of times as well.  And going out 
to the canal area, enjoying the water out there. But Shelton, itself, not a lot of options.

Fenale Interviewer: All right. Well, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much.

 Linda Simington: You're very welcome.
