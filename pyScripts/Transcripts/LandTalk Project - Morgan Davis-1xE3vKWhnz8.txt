Morgan: Okay, so I'm Morgan Davis and I'm interviewing my mom, Jenny Davis. So, describe the way Papillion used to look.

Jenny: The area, Papillion, that we live in used to be a lot more country, a lot more private. We left the neighborhood because we didn't have a lot of privacy and kids wanted to run around, there was nothing to do. So we found an acreage out off of a dirt road, and we moved there and started fixing it up. It was an old hundred-year-old farmhouse and the kids just ran around and played in the barns and looked for treasure and found birds and squirrels and all kinds of fun things to play with, raised goats, chickens, and ducks. It was just very private and cozy.

Morgan: Describe how Papillion has changed since then.

Jenny: We had one big change. The county came because we live on a road that leads to Offit [SP] Base. And they decided to pave the road, which took away all of our privacy. They cut down 26 60-foot trees and it opened us up to basically a model bomb in front of our house. We still live the way we used to live but it's we lost a lot of our privacy and had to replant trees. But the good things about that are we don't have as many ruined tires. Our cars are cleaner because it was terribly muddy. when it rained, it was awful to drive on the dirt roads. And they've brought some stores down the street, grocery store. That's really nice. But neighborhoods are starting to come in now. And we're starting to have...well, they're not right next to us but they're coming.

Morgan: Okay, what were some of the things you used to do in Papillion?

Jenny: Some of the things we used to do here? We just played with the kids and worked in the yard and gardened and slam the kids in the yard. So things like that, just we did it here. Yeah.

Morgan: What are some things you do now that there's like a mall and newly paved road?

Jenny: We don't do a whole lot differently. I wouldn't say we do a whole lot differently. I don't think it's been super long since we do, I guess we do want to eat a little more because there's restaurants closer and a TJ Maxx down the street. So, we pretty much go there every day but not a whole lot besides that.

Morgan: Awesome. Well, that's all the questions I have for you. Thanks for letting me interview you.

Jenny: Thank you.

Morgan: Love you.
