I bought my home in 1994. Back at that time, they hadn't developed any of this area down through the LA wash, and so it was very unmanicured and run down. And farther upstream there was an old wooden bridge, a footbridge that crossed the river. That was the way it was the first couple years when I moved here.

In the late '90s, they replaced the old wooden footbridge with this very structurally sound concrete bridge that was surprising because it hadn't had much use. We found out later then, that they had plans to develop this half-mile stretch of the LA River. They went on to pour in a couple million dollars worth of landscaping pads and completely redid that side of the wash, talking about it being like San Antonio Texas where people would come and shop and then walk along the river.

When I first moved here there wasn't much to do down here. You'd walk the dog but it wasn't a very nice path, it wasn't well developed. So mostly it would just be to cross the river on the old wooden footbridge and get to the other side where the retail and the dining was.

Now with the path on the other side, it's possible to go biking or to go walking or running and to just enjoy the scenery. So it's a much nicer place on the other side of the river to be able to enjoy.
