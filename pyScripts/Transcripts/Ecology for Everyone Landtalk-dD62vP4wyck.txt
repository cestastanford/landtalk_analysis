Interviewee: [inaudible 00:00:01] and I was a resident of the Boston area for almost 20 years.

Interviewer: Okay. So I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the Big Dig and like I know it changed a lot over the time that you lived there. So I just wanted to get a feel for like how it looked beforehand like, what the area look before the project. How did the area look before the project was started?

Interviewee: So the interesting thing is that I wasn't really aware that there was anything wrong with the way the area looked. It looked like a city that, you know, had a reasonable access route to the airport and it looked like there was enough green space. However, as it started to change, what I started to understand was they made things more accessible and so they added another tunnel. They created access to a whole another part of the city. And it fundamentally altered the landscape, how people perceive the city and how people got around in the city.

Interviewer: Yep. Okay. Okay. So, actually, I guess I don't really know that much. Was it just like an area changed or was it like the Big Dig is like...so I do remember it happening. I can remember seeing like things about, I think on TV and stuff like that. And I remember like talking about it in the classroom. So it wasn't just like one area that changed. It was just like a big project, right?

Interviewee: Yes, it was a big project and you could probably google it and see what it entailed. But it was multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. They literally dug up sections of Boston and they cleaned up part of the Boston Harbor. They dug a new tunnel from the city of Boston out to the airport. They changed the access from the western suburbs to the city itself and just directly to the airport. So they made it easier to get from the western suburbs.

So they literally dug up a section of the Mass Turnpike and added a new section there. And then in the financial district, just by South Station, they literally just had a decision to make more green space. So from Chinatown, all the way down through, I would say, Little Italy, they took up...the old section of town had trellises for the train. And so they took all those trellises' down and then dug up the street to create these open spaces that were walkable and that were green. And then South Boston is the area where you saw the most change in terms of the development, where they literally...South Boston used to, sort of end at one street.

What they literally did was expanded the whole area and they dug up areas of that community and added hotels, added office buildings. They created a brand new line for the trains with the T. And the Silver Line now was moving through the south end of Boston through to South Boston. So I'm thinking about it as well, they did the same thing in terms of getting rid of those, train trellises in Roxbury and that area, Dudley Square. I believe that was also part of the overall project. So, you know, for years, these things had been part of the city landscape. And, you know, it was expected that, you know, you could be walking in the city and you have these huge train track areas over you. But they got rid of all of them.

Interviewer: So, okay. I'm trying to think of any question and like, prevalence to the questions that I mentioned earlier. But like, I mean, I guess you kind of answered that in terms of like, how it changed like, you know, just what you see, you know, when you go to different parts. And then also like how it changed like your kind of interaction with different parts of the city again like getting into different parts of the city.

Interviewee: Yes. So you could get from the western parts of the city, the way it used to be is that, you would come on the Mass Turnpike and then you'd come through the city to get to the airport. What they did is they changed it so that you could get from the western suburbs on the Mass Pike. And as you started getting closer to the city, literally, they created this path, a road and a new tunnel that gave you the ability to go express through the city without having to be in the city and, you know, go/stop lights and all that kind of stuff. You can go literally directly to the tunnel to get to the airport. So it probably saved on average 20 plus minutes in terms of your commute to the airport.

Interviewer: Wow. Wow. That's crazy.

Interviewee: And digging the tunnel, I mean, you got to think about it. This tunnel went from...it connected the city itself to the airport area and had to go across the Boston Harbor.

Interviewer: Just wondering in terms like the labor force that like, was it a big...? I don't know, I feel like the number of people working on the different projects, like was there an increase in the number of...I guess like, construction kind of workers or like an increased demand for that...?
