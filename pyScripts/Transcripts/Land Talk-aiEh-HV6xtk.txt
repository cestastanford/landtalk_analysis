Maddison: Hello. My name is Maddison Alvarez, and I will be interviewing...

Nixon: Nixon Alvarez.

Maddison: ....regarding his hometown and the change. So, please state your hometown and where you're from.

Nixon: I'm from El Salvador, from a place called Acajutla. The town is called La Uni√≥n.

Maddison: So tell me about this place. What do you remember as a child? What was, like, the environment that you remember?

Nixon: It was a great place. Well, you have four seasons there. Actually two, sorry.

Maddison: No worries.

Nixon: It's two seasons, which is the summer and winter. As I said, obviously, you have spring and end of fall too, but it's not the same as in the United States.

Maddison: What was your favorite thing as a child, doing there?

Nixon: My favorite thing was go to a river and play.

Maddison: Tell me more about the river? How is the river like now?

Nixon: The river had abundant water. And now, the river dries up in the summertime. It dries up completely. The water completely stops running. And that's caused by man. Men have, I guess, enclosed the water to provide water to the houses.

Maddison: What else has changed around the area, from when you were a child?

Nixon: I remember there was a stretch of road where it was no trees or houses in that, maybe like two miles of road. And now, there is houses and now there's trees along the street or the road. And there's a campus, a university campus there now, which has, I guess it has helped created this new look of that road.

Maddison: Have there been any major environmental changes like earthquakes, or...?

Nixon: Well, definitely the country has many active volcanoes. And also, there are always earthquakes going on. As recent as May 27 or something like that, was an earthquake which was a 3.6.

Maddison: So, it's always been earthquakes throughout your lifetime there?

Nixon: Yes.

Maddison: It's a regular thing? So, nothing has changed about that.

Nixon: Right.

Maddison: What do you miss the most back from back then compared to now?

Nixon: I can say, definitely the river, since that was my childhood playground, I would call it.

Maddison: What activities...well, you just said your activities, going to this lake.

Nixon: Going to the river.

Maddison: To the river. Right, well, that'd be all.

Nixon: All right.

Maddison: Thank you so much.

Nixon: You're welcome.

Maddison: Bye.

Nixon: My pleasure.
