A lot of positive environmental changes have occurred in Huntington Beach since I was a child. When I was old enough to become aware of my surroundings, probably in the mid to late '70s, Huntington Beach was a blue collar coastal town dominated by the oil and gas industry. We not only had offshore oil rigs, which were unsightly, there was a lot of drilling and above ground oil rigs, pipelines, and all sorts of environmental wastes, even across from my high school in a big dump next to, funny enough, the recreational center. Nobody really knows if it's related to the dump, but there have been quite a number of people from our class who have died of brain and other assorted cancers. There seems to be a cancer cluster closely associated with this environmental waste area.

Luckily by the '90s, the oil was no longer profitable for Chevron so they sold the land off for development. And there have been many positive changes. All of the oil infrastructure has now been eliminated. A lot of nice properties have been built and redeveloped, but I think the most remarkable thing is that Huntington Beach is home to one of the largest coastal wetlands in Southern California. And they were able to take this area that was landlocked and punched through to the ocean so that they could now get fresh saltwater back into the marsh area, and it has rebounded remarkably.

In fact, I think it is one of the top birding spots there is, definitely in Southern California, but people actually come there from all over the world due to its unique species. I think some of the development has not had a positive impact on the environment, but anything next to the beach these days, they seem to build whatever they feel like. But great efforts have been made to clean up the litter, to clean up the water. In fact, I do remember when I was a kid, one of the beaches near us, we used to call it Tin Can Beach because it was just litter everywhere in the Bolsa Chica Area, and now all of that is gone. You really couldn't even walk on the sand without having your sandals on because it would cut your feet. It was so bad.

But I think now, overall, they've done a very, very good job and I think the awareness of people to not litter and to respect their environment has also played a large impact on the rebound of these coastal areas.

I also noticed that when we were kids, when you walked on the beach or walked on the sand, you would also get oil and tar and all kinds of debris stuck to the bottom of your feet. So, again, you had to wear sandals whenever you went near the water. But it seems that all of that has been cleared up at this point, and it seems like the wildlife has returned, except for the fish. There is a definite drop in the amount, quality and quantity of the fish that are available in the ocean. And that may be due to the runoff from the development and some of the toxicity that has bloomed in the water due to the runoff.

When it rains in southern California, all of the water basically goes into the ocean, and with it, it carries all of the road grease, oil, contaminants, pesticides, garbage, you name it. And I know there's always a surfing ban for, like, 72 hours before you can go in the water. And I'm not sure there's anything that could be done about that but it's definitely affected the wildlife and the amount of fish that we have available for sport fishing and for consumption.
