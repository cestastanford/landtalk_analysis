Lee: Okay. So, I guess first off could you describe your connection to Marin, sort of how long you've been there? And yeah, just generally more about your connection to Marin County.

Interviewee: Sure. I was born and raised here. And then went on this campus for college and graduate school and then came back up to raise my family. I've a big family and they're all in Bay Area. And I think one thing that's interesting is my grandmother and great grandmother were also born in Marin. So that was the side of my family, the German side, sailed to, you know, around South America and stopped in Mexico City for a little bit and then sailed into San Francisco, before the Gold Rush, to start the first bookstore in San Francisco. I know. It's cool.

Lee: I didn't know that story. That's awesome.

Interviewee: I know. I think it's cool.

Lee: Cool. And then could you describe how Marin used to look, maybe when you were a child and sort of how it's transformed a little bit?

Interviewee: Sure. Let me just think about this for a minute. So growing up, because my mom and my dad, but my mom particularly, loved wildflowers, the outdoors, we spent a lot of time in Marin's open spaces. From Geopark over in Fairfax to Scenic Lake, to the marsh area down by Baysitch [SP], to that Wolfback Ridge which is just above Sausalito, to the amphitheater, blah, blah, blah. And during that time, when I was a really little kid, I wasn't as aware of it, but there was a big, huge fight going on to build like a six-lane freeway directly to Point Reyes, and build homes all along it. And these amazing conservation people, which ultimately became the Marin Conversation League, fought to stop that. 

And so, what I appreciate so much with Marin, and what I think is very rare, is that a huge amount of open space has remained undeveloped because the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, number one. Number two, the important fact that we get our water from local reservoirs. So we have the Marin Municipal Water District kind of wires that space that we don't have building on. And then the various state parks in Point Reyes that create this huge quarter of a lot of open space. So, I think that's like so unique in the U.S. that that didn't get developed. 

So that part has remained unchanged and one of the reasons why I think I love living here and so many people told us it's like an awesome place to live. In terms of what has changed, like for sure, the town center, that got built. The [inaudible 00:03:41] at Northgate, the mall, not the town center, the other one, the Village. The Village got built. That shopping center where Costco is... Can you hear me, Lee?

Lee: Yeah, I can hear you. It cuts out a little bit, but I can still hear you.

Interviewee: Yeah, somebody's calling on call waiting, which we're just gonna ignore. I think it should stop now.

So, like the Northgate Mall was there, but then it got a huge facelift and expansion. The Village was built right out on the bay. And I've noticed, with real disappointment, that they just built this huge parking lot further out into the bay...you know where they used that gravel part? 

Le: Yeah, yeah.

Interviewee: That's now cemented in. And so it's like a huge... I don't know. It's like a large parking lot. Now that's cemented in, right? From a global warming or from a climate change point of view, it's like right on...you know how close it is to the marsh there, right?

Lee: Yeah, yeah. So it's kinda... 

Interviewee: So I'm like, kind of like, "What wtf?" Like, "Why did they have to... They know we're having a problem." The town center, you know, they redid. And there's been like new housing in Tiburon. For example, one new housing, kind of high-density housing, and that's been kind of a disappointment, is where the Dixie Cup Factory is?

Lee: I don't know where that is.

Interviewee: You know where when you get off... You know where the DMV is, on Campbell [inaudible 00:05:16]? 

Lee: Yeah, yeah.

Interviewee: It's across the street from this DMV. It's like this really ugly, new, high-density housing that Larkspur or Corte Madera agreed to. So, additional development on some of the regions and the shopping centers, where some of the towns have stayed the same, and in some cases, because of the whole everybody buying stuff online, retail's struggling in a place like San Anselmo or where Ambrosia [SP] used to be in Kentfield there.

Lee: Yeah, yeah. So in terms of changes, more specifically to you, are there any things, any activities that you were able to do in Marin, or even that you used to do in Marin as a kid, that you either can't do now or you don't do now? Mainly in terms of outdoor spaces and some of the open spaces you were talking about?

Interviewee: Trying to think about that. Well, I think, like the area where the Village was, you know, where the Village is and where that new parking space, that is a cool bay area. So, they've still got a trail on it, but it's really been kind of minimized by that. 

Certainly, traffic has affected the ability to get in and out of San Francisco. I think it's not preventing me from doing something, but one thing is that flooding is a lot more frequent. You know, when you exit to go to Kentfield, that kind of low point there. I'm thinking. So, not too much, but also I would say I gotta mind hiking along ways or riding along ways. I gotta know if it were somebody who were less into exercise and outbound, if they might feel like more stuff has been cut off. You know what I mean?

Lee: Right. Do feel like you have to, say, drive further now to get to areas where you'd wanna hike? Or have you generally been hiking in the same areas since you were young?

Interviewee: Pretty much hiking in the same areas. I think, again, thanks to the combinations of [inaudible 00:08:09] and the state parks and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.  But it takes me a little longer maybe to get there now.

Lee: Well, I guess, similarly, are there any things that you are able to do now that you weren't before? Not necessarily as it relates to outdoor spaces, but if there's any sort of new things going on in Marin that you've been doing now.

Interviewee: Yeah. In fact, one thing I forgot on the shopping center one is the construction of Larkspur Landing. Because it used to be that big quarry where that quarry probably was. So there's more movie theaters. And that's why I thought of the Larkspur Landing thing. So there's a lot more movie theaters to go to. There's certainly more stores to go to. So it's kind of the opposite of you don't have to go into the city to go to Nordstrom, for example.

I'm thinking what else can I do now? Well, I think we always had the ferry, but it does seem like the ferry's trying to become more work-oriented in terms of like leaving times during the day. What else can I do? Yeah, there's shopping centers over...you think of where they developed The Home Depot. You know that whole bay part?

Lee: Yeah, yeah.

Interviewer: That was interesting because that used to be... When I was a kid, I had memories of going with all of us and memories going with my dad to the dump. Like we would do all this gardening and then take this trailer and go to the dump. And we would certainly back up the trailer. It'd be like a 15-foot drop off in terms of stacking. I know. And so now, there's like a Home Depot built on that. There is a little kind of less direct access to the bay itself. Like fewer places to get to the water.  

Lee: Cool. Well, those are the main questions. Is there anything else that you think might be of interest about Marin in terms of transformations or lack thereof?

Interviewee: Well, I think one thing that hasn't changed, that is a disappointment, is there's no boat or rapid transit from San Francisco to Marin. I mean, I don't know why the Golden Gate Bridge can't support that. But that would make life easier. We've got that thing now between Santa Rosa and San Rafael, whatever that train is called. But it still falls far short. Then you have, I think you're gonna get a bus to the ferry building in Larkspur. It becomes a long process to get to the city. 

So that's kind of a disappointment. And then, in general, I think people need to be more open-minded about...we need people to be able to live closer to where jobs are. So, not necessarily... Like, I didn't like that high-density thing by the DMV because it's just so poorly done. But I do think we need to make it easy for people to live near where they work.

And I do think...I mean, it's only my personal [inaudible 00:12:04], but I do think it's in general raining a lot less and snowing a lot less. I think we've had, like just in the... You know, as a kid growing up in our... This is sort of getting off of the Marin thing. But our cabin, you know, where that is?

Lee: Yeah.

Interviewee: It gets so much snowfall. Normally, you could walk into this snow door and the second door or have to dig out the snow door. And that's very rare now. 

Lee: Yeah. So just snow?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Lee: Cool. Well, those are all of my questions.
