Man 1: So I'm interviewing my grandfather who lives in Acworth, Georgia. So, how would you describe the way Acworth used to look? 

Man 2: Well, we originally moved to our house in Acworth in 1988, in March of 1988. The land surrounding us used to be owned by a local farmer who sold the land to a developer, and the developer and a golf course architect designed a golf course, and they built that development around the golf course. Since then, there's been a lot of changes in the whole area. Local grocery stores have moved in. When we were originally here, the first grocery store was about 8 miles away. Now the local grocery store is only, like, three-quarters of a mile from our house.

Man 1: Okay. So what are some of the things that you used to do in Acworth, back when you first moved, in comparison to what you enjoy doing now?

Man 2: Well, when we first moved to Acworth, we both worked for Delta Airlines. And so we drove to the airport, which was approximately 35 miles each way. I retired in 2003 and my wife retired in 2016.

Meme: Fifteen, not sixteen.

Man 2: And since then, we basically go see our grandkids, our family, and we play a lot of golf, and we do a lot of traveling.

Meme: Tell them about...It was only one restaurant in Acworth. 

Man 2: [inaudible 00:01:51].

Meme: Well, he wants to know about Acworth.

Man 1: And so what...don't you...Grandma Meme, doesn't she like to walk around and, you know, in the area, too? And, Meme, you can get on and talk about the area when you walk as well.

Man 2: Yeah, there's a lot of... Meme does a lot of walking. Here, I'll let her explain her walking.

Meme: When we first moved out here, I could walk everywhere. There was no traffic. I'd see deer running across the road. It was just a wonderful place to be. I didn't have worry about getting run over by traffic. Now, the traffic is so bad I just stay in the neighborhood. I don't venture out too far. But also, when we first moved out here, there was only one place to eat in Acworth and that was a Mexican food restaurant. And that was the only restaurant in Acworth to go eat.

Right, and so now there's three or four different restaurants in Acworth and they've... Downtown Acworth was just buildings. They didn't have anything. Now they've really developed downtown Acworth, and there's an Italian place, Henry's Seafood, couple of sandwich places. Actually, there's two Italian places. They've really developed downtown Acworth.

Man 1: Cool. Well, thank you all so much.
