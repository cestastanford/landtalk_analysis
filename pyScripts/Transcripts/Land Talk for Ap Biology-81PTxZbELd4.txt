Interviewer: ...some questions and just answer them freely. 

Interviewee: Okay. 

Interviewer: Okay. How would you say the environment has changed over the last 20 years? 

Interviewee: Okay. Changed just in general or just in this area?

Interviewer: In this area.

Interviewee: In this area, in the last 20 years, how the environment has changed? 

Interviewer: Yes. 

Interviewee: I think there's a lot more pollution for there's tons more cars. I think like, oh, pollution from cars and there's so much more built now. I'd say like there's not as much nature as there [inaudible 00:00:37] was 20 years ago, especially on the west side of town. So, I guess for Bloomington, there's just not as much... Well, like, when they paved the highway not that long ago. Like, but you know, where Tapp [SP] Road goes down to the highway, where you used to go to the highway. There was bats, they have their special bat origin around right and it's called brown bats that are like not quite extinct totally, but they're getting kind of close to it. Yeah. [inaudible 00:01:08]. Keep it that. I think that the, but it's like, so they tore those all down. So I think it has gotten, definitely in terms of the environment, there's definitely like species that are [inaudible 00:01:23] for that, I think prevent building highways or, you know, if they took all the water out of that creek as you go down 37 right there. So I'd say just loss of habitat. And let's see, that's probably it. That's the biggest thing I see is just loss of habitat, not as much and more pollution, definitely more pollution in terms of like, I'm sure the air, but also I think just in general, more trash that you see on the road, [inaudible 00:02:03] on the road than used to be. So, yeah, I'd say that kind of stuff. 

Interviewer: What animals did you see 20 years ago?

Interviewee: What animals did I see 20 years ago? I saw, let me think. Like just in general? Okay. Like different than what...I mean, you know, dogs, cats, deer. I would say I see more deer now because I think they're being taken out of the habitats they used to be in. So I think that deer are coming more into the cities. I think that that... Gosh. 

Interviewer: Do you remember what birds you saw? 

Interviewee: Oh, birds. Good question. Cardinals, Robins, you know, Blue Jays. And I didn't know about all the birds we have now. So I, in my little world, I see my birds now. It doesn't mean there's more birds. It doesn't mean that there's more birds now. I know there's not for sure, like on the migration of where they go. Like the migration from Costa Rica and they kind of go through this area up through and they go to Canada. I would say there's...you know, that's declined. But for me personally, I would say, you know, it'd probably be [inaudible 00:03:43].  

Oh. Even 20 years ago, [inaudible 00:03:57] because actually we've been married for 25...we lived in a log cabin at that time. So I'm trying to envision. We had a log cabin [inaudible 00:04:07]. I mean, owls. I heard owls.  

Interviewer: That's okay if you can't remember.

Interviewee: Okay. That's all I'm thinking of now. 

Interviewer: Has the construction affected the environment? 

Interviewee: Oh yes. Big time. Big time. 

Interviewer: Would you say more negatively than positively? 

Interviewee: Yes, for sure. 

Interviewer: How has your lifestyle in nature changed over the past 20 years? 

Interviewee: I [inaudible 00:04:44]. Well, I would say like, we don't... How has my lifestyle changed? Well, definitely by waking up to water, for sure, 20 years ago and past that. I mean, typically more camping and so I think it was easier for like number one, making [inaudible 00:05:04] back then, like having a fire was not that big a deal that we knew of, you know what I mean? And now I think you do a lot of things like you have to buy the firewood at that place that you go camping at because they're worried about, I think it's like certain molds and bedbugs and stuff that can be brought in from other places. And maybe they really just weren't aware of that, so it was a  gap. I don't know, but I just know that something that's different is that you can't just bring firewood into like a campsite of your own. You have to bring, you have to buy the firewood from that area, you know, from that campsite that provides it. And I'd say like, so definitely we don't camp as much, but I do love, you know, I love camping. More camping. I'd say, in a weird way, I didn't always feel safe with...by myself in the environment 20 years ago. I definitely do not feel safe by myself in the environment camping now even. I don't know if that's really environmental though. That's more like... Environmentally... 

Interviewer: I know you like to bird watch. How have the birds changed?  

Interviewee: Yeah. So, okay, that's good, [inaudible 00:06:23] but totally way more birds. I'm [inaudible 00:06:22] So, yeah, no, that's something that's way more due to the environment. Sure. For sure. I mean, it's just more trips than just going into the, and definitely. I'm more headed in that way, okay, for sure that it's affected me big time in terms of don't see the birds and going to, I mean I go to generally a lot of different areas in [inaudible 00:06:54] County to go birding. So, but I went a long time ago too when Mark [inaudible 00:07:02] Mark took a class in college, a birding class and I was interested in it and tried to go one time and then kinda got into it. And then my friend Mary Kay and I, she was into it and my mom, you know, she and my mom kind of got me into it too. So, yeah. So I think I definitely that's something that [inaudible 00:07:22] way more for sure, it's birding and all places in the environment around here. So, yeah. 

Interviewer: Has the weather changed over time? 

Interviewee: For sure. I think it's way warmer. I personally think it's warmer in the fall and late summer and winter even. I think it'll way delay winter. I don't think the winters are nothing like they used to be in Bloomington in the past, for sure, 20 years. And I think it's sometimes cooler in the spring than it used to be, but I will say [inaudible 00:08:07] of birding, this has been [inaudible 00:08:07] is that the leaves bloom, that when you're birding, you don't want to see as much leaves. Right. Because you can see the bird quicker and easier. I mean, when it's...when [inaudible 00:08:21] totally has bloomed. Right? Because you can find things better on a tree. Now it seems like they fall and bloom and, you know, grow a lot quicker. So it's harder to see birds now in the springtime compared to what it used to be. That's one thing I noticed for sure, but I...

 Interviewer: What do... Oh, sorry.

Interviewee: No, no, you're good. That's it. 

Interviewer: What do you miss about the past environment? 

Interviewee: Well, because I miss... I think I'm gonna stick to freedom because... Is that okay? That's not really environmental though. Can we say environmentally? Does it matter?

Interviewer: It should be around...

Interviewee: Environmentally. Okay. Well, I mean, I think the biggest thing is just the amount of just like building that's going on and just seeing more landscape, more...like, especially like I keep saying the west side, but that's where. Well, and the east side now too. I mean, there's so many things that have been built that I miss kind of just seeing more green. 

Interviewer: Yeah. 

Interviewee: You know, for sure. 

Interviewer: All right. I think that concludes everything for this interview. Thank you for letting me interview you. It was great.

Interviewee: You are so welcome. You are so welcome.
