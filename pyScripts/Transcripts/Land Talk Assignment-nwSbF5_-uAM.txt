Interviewer: All right. So Grandma, so what location are you going to be talking about?

Interviewee: Oh my gosh. I'm going to be talking about Hilmar. Hilmar has really grown.

Interviewer: Okay, so how did this place look before?

Interviewee: It didn't have very many houses and it was a smaller town. I don't even know how many people it has in this town. It's fairly, relatively pretty small town. But our schools are overflowing now because people are trying to come into our town. We don't even have a police station. We have only a post office, one store, and Walgreens, and maybe two or three beauty shops. It's very small. It doesn't have very many stores. It's kind of like a little country town. And a block behind me, there's even a dairy right here, just right out of the city limits, a dairy.

Interviewer: So how has it changed over the years?

Interviewee: Well, there's some more houses being built. They're putting in [inaudible 00:01:28] in their houses and they're building more houses by Hilmar Cheese, which is a co-op creamery. They make cheese and they are co-op owners. And what else? And that's about it.

Interviewer: Okay, so then what are some of the things that you used to do there?

Interviewee: There's not much you can do here. The only things I've done is go to kids' baseball games, football games, school functions. This is a very tight community involving kids from the schools. And the parents do a lot of things for the kids in this. It's a big ag area and four H.

Interviewer: So then those are basically some of the same things you do here now. It's not changed as much over time?

Interviewee: It's not what? 

Interviewer: Hasn't changed as much over time then. It sounds like you've been doing pretty much some of the same things?

Interviewee: The same, yeah, I usually go see my grandkids. They started with T ball. I've gone to all their games and I go to all their games and functions. Portuguese culture's really big here in Hilmar. There are a lot of Portuguese people and they have, what's that called? They have a [inaudible 00:03:12] box of things going on for the kids at school, plays and different things. But there's not like shopping here, stores. If you want to go somewhere you have to go out of town to go shopping. [inaudible 00:03:28] find something different. One used car place, that's about it, about four churches, two big ones. That's about it.

Interviewer: Great that's all the questions.
