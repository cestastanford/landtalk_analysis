Interviewer: Hi Mama, so I'm going to be interviewing you for my bio 30 class. Can you tell me the name of the location that you're talking about? 

Avisha: It's Ruparel in Mumbai, central Mumbai. 

Interviewer: How did this place look before?

Avisha: You know, we moved here in 98 and it looked very different at that time. The textile mills of Mumbai had been shut for about 20 years before that because of labor union problems. So for 20 years, nothing was happening here. In fact, the mill workers who were very poor were living in shanties all over the place. There is a huge slum and they were small you know, low-cost housing and the area looked completely run-down and something that hasn't been used for about 20 years. So it was, in fact, not nice at all, but this building was very beautiful and had a very large area for the kids and a pool. So that was the reason we moved there but yes, the area looked completely run-down. In fact, it looked like a ghost town. It was the only tall building at that time in this area, 

Interviewer: And how has it changed in the last 19, 20 years? 

Avisha: You know, you can't even recognize it today. It is the most happening part of Mumbai, it's called central Mumbai and the slums have been removed. The low-cost housing because of the slum rehabilitation redevelopment program has all lead to tall towers as well as the builders had to construct 20 story buildings, low-cost housing for the mill workers. So they were also moved from a very run-down area to actually small houses, which are in tall towers with elevators. The kind of housing which has been developed in this part in the last 20 years is phenomenal. Some of the richest residences are here. 

Also, it is the most popular area for commercial property, so all the multinational companies in the last 20 years have moved to this area. Also the best mall with the top brands, international top brands has come up in one of the mill areas and I would say you can't even recognize this space. Flyovers have come up, a lot of you know, development footpaths have been constructed, the entire area looks like something else now. In fact, it's the fastest growing developing area and one of the most expensive real estate now in Mumbai. So I think you can't even recognize it if you look at what it was 20 years ago. 

Interviewer: What are some things that you used to do here 19, 20 years ago?

Avisha: You know, there wasn't much to do. In fact, you couldn't do anything in this area. You couldn't step out of your building because there was no footpath. The entire place looked like a very old 1950 cell housing with the, you know, unemployed mill workers all around the area, even to the point of looking almost unsafe. In fact, the school were outside the area, there were no office properties inside this area. You had to step out to work, to study, to eat. There was no movie hall, there was not even a single restaurant in the entire area or a shop.

Today, I would say two or three-kilometer radius would have about 500 restaurants and huge office building. So yes, there wasn't anything to do at that time. 

Interviewer: And then what are some things that you do even now you out, you kind of already answered it but maybe you could just build on that a little bit more?

Avisha: Yeah, I think you don't have to step out of this area now. There are schools here, there are offices here, my husband's office, my office is in this area so we don't really step out for work outside this area. As I said, it has 500 restaurants of every kind of food from across the world, which is being served here. It has a multiplex cinema, it has a seven-star hotel on premises. So I can tell you one thing, you really don't need to step out of this area. You can do everything pretty much want to do, there's a bowling alley. There is an indoor auditorium, there is you know, play area, video games area. Every kind of entertainment that you ever want is in this area. So honestly speaking, I don't think you really need to step outside this, so it's really developed very well and the real estate has gone up like 10X in the last 20 years. So it is one of the fastest, most expensive area today. 

Interviewer: Thank you and then is there anything else you want to add about Ruparel in general or is that it?
