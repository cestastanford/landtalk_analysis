Interviewer: Hello. Thank you for taking the time [inaudible 00:00:01] today. What place have you decided to talk about? 

Interviewee: The Batiquitos Lagoon.

Interviewer: And where is that?

Interviewee: It's in the City of Carlsbad, just north of Encinitas where we live. 

Interviewer: In Southern California. And yeah, and the latitude and longitude are 33 degrees, five minutes north, and 117 degrees, 17 minutes away. So, how did this place look before maybe, you know, 20, 30 years ago when you used to go here or see this place?

Interviewee: So, we purchased our first home in 1993, which was in a development that was built in the '70s close to the lagoon. And we lived there about 15 years. And during that time, a lot of developments happened. New construction, new homes. It used to just be more lagoon, you know, wildlife area, I guess.

And definitely, as part of the construction for the homes, I think that they made sure that the lagoon would be preserved, as well as there was some enhancements that needed to be done, because they felt that the lagoon had accumulated a lot of silt and that it wouldn't last for more than about 50 years at that time. So, there was a lot of dredging and an enhancement project that I think was part of what the taxes went towards from the new construction. There was lots of open land, but they did a nice job in preserving the immediate area around the lagoon.

Interviewer: Okay. And, like, what were some of the things that you or other people used to do here? I know you said in, like, 1992, way back when?

Interviewee: We used to just go on hikes, just, you know, walk around the lagoon. There was never any boating allowed, but it was just an open area. There wasn't really setups formally for any hiking, and now, actually, it is.

Interviewer: Yeah. So, sort of some of the things people do here now are...?

Interviewee: Well, there's a Lagoon Foundation that was established, and there are trails. There's a visitor's center, and it's all run by volunteers. There's a lot of kids to go on field trips. There's kiosks in different areas describing, you know, the wildlife, including, you know, the vegetation and the animals that you might see during your tour. So it's a self-guided tour, but there are also docents that volunteer.

Interviewer: Cool. Is there anything else you wanna add before we wrap up?

Interviewee: I don't think so. Nope. Beautiful area and I'm happy that it's been preserved. It's about 610 acres.

Interviewer: Well, all right. Well, thank you so much for your time.

Interviewee: You're welcome.
