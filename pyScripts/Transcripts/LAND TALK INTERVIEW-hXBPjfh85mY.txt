The following project is a land talk interview done with my father for our school project. He's talking about how Maryland was 20 years ago and his experience with it. He is a shy person, so I have recorded his answers in written form, and I will be answering the questions for him as I interviewed him in person.

The first question was, "Can you please introduce yourself, name, age, and occupation?" His answer was, "Jamie Chicas, 38, occupation is insulator."

"How has Maryland changed in the last 20 years?" He responded, "Maryland has changed mostly in the technological aspect. Before, there was no internet or social media, so people talked to each other in person not through a screen."

Then I asked, "What do you remember from when you first moved here?" He responded, "The cost of living was less for each person. Things used to cost less money. For example, a packet of gum would cost $1 before or 75 cents at most, but now it is almost $3. Things are more expensive."

Then I asked, "What is your favorite part about living here in Maryland?" He responded, "The fact that there are better benefits here even though the cost of living is higher, you earn more money. When I was a kid, I lived in Texas and I ended up liking Maryland more, even though my relatives live in Texas."

Then I asked, "What kind of hobbies have you picked up here in Maryland?" He responded, "One hobby that I have picked up and I've done lately is to walk in the malls with my family. I like spending quality time with them and being with my kids, it relieves stress from the hard week of work."

Then I asked, "What do you miss about Maryland 20 years ago compared to now?" His response was, "I miss the people when we're united. Families used to come together and spend time with each other, but now they don't."

Then I asked, "Why do you think that people choose not to spend time with their families anymore?" His response was, "I believe it is because people have changed. There is more people who don't have the humbleness within them. It is like it has disappeared."

Then I asked, "What is one way that people could go back to humbling ways?" And he responded, "That they would go back to old times because social media, internet surfing, and video games have taken away people's time. This internet barrier creates a divide between real connections of two people as real friends, creating real bonds that humble you."

Then I asked, "Going back to the interview, what animals have you seen here?" He responded, "Deers, racoons, the urial, rabbits, and mice," he chuckled, "Also insects."

"Have there been any big storms in the last 20 years?" I asked. He responded, "I remember the big storm in 2006, 2005, 2007 or 2008, I'm not quite sure which year it was, but I remember it clearly, the name was hurricane Katrina. It didn't directly hit Maryland, but it had some effects. I also remember a big blizzard when you, your sister, and your mother first came. I remember it was your first time seeing snow, you fell face flat on it because you thought it wasn't real."

Then I asked, "What has been a major change in your life from 20 years ago to now?" He responded, "I am more old," he chuckled, "But not also that, like I said before, technology. Phones were bricks and more expensive. Now, things are HD and cheap. My daughter Paula was small and fragile, and now she's really big and strong."

Then the last question was, "To conclude this interview, I have one more question to ask, if you could go back in time and bring one item with you from 20 years ago, what would it be and why?" His response shocked me as he is a man of little words and I don't have many conversations with him. But when a question like this is posed, he shows his true thoughts, "I would bring back my youth because it would make me look younger and have that age with the knowledge that I've gained over the last 20 years. I would have made less errors in life with the knowledge that I've gained if I were to go back and get my youth, so that I don't make the same mistakes that I made in the past."

And that was the interview with my father. It was through audio and it was just me due to his shyness. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I hope you enjoyed. Goodbye.
