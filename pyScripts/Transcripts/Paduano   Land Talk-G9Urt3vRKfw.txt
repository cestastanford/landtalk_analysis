Stephen: This is Stephen Paduano recording the Land Talk Project for Ecology for Everyone and I am here with my mother, Ruth Parette, who is going to tell me about Sand Hill Road then and now. So, mom, for my first question, can you just describe how Sand Hill Road used to look perhaps when you were growing up and a little more recently?

Ruth: So, we lived in Palo Alto and beginning in the early '60s, my father worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and so we had the opportunity to go up Sand Hill Road to SLAC pretty frequently. We do school field trips when I was in elementary school and then subsequently moved near there and I went to junior high school on Sand Hill Road in Sharon Heights at a school called La Entrada. And, back in...and that started in like 1970 something. You can figure out when. And, back then, there really wasn't much on Sand Hill Road. You had Sharon Heights to the right and then there was a lot of undeveloped land going all the way up Sand Hill Road with SLAC over on the left and there really just wasn't much else there. It was just...

Stephen: Were there trees, was there grass?

Ruth: There were trees and fields.

Stephen: Would people play in the fields?

Ruth: I don't remember people playing in the fields. There may have been some horses in the fields but I don't remember anybody playing in the fields. It was just basically unincorporated land that abutted either side of Sand Hill Road.

Stephen: And was there much traffic or was it...

Ruth: There was very little traffic. 

Stephen: ...a really empty space?

Ruth: It was pretty empty space. And, the first time it struck me how much Sand Hill Road changed was probably around 1999, 2000. Because by 1999, 2000, a lot of development started sprouting on either side of Sand Hill Road, office space all the way up and down Sand Hill Road. This was even before the Rosewood Hotel was built. And, so as it...

Stephen: And what sort of development was this?

Ruth: They were office buildings. A lot of office buildings up and down Sand Hill Road. And, what was the probably the most perceptible even more than how the fields were overbuilt was traffic on Sand Hill Road where all of a sudden it became just a horrible parking lot and it was hard to get up and down Sand Hill Road.

Stephen: So, back when you were going to school and going on field trips, would you really just drive by, drive through? Would you ever stop and go on the fields or was that not really done with the other recreation spaces? 

Ruth: It really wasn't...there wasn't much there. It was just more that it was open...

Stephen: It was just empty.

Ruth: ...undeveloped fields.

Stephen: And, do you find yourself back on Sand Hill Road ever now?

Ruth: I'm back on Sand Hill Road a lot because I go to the Rosewood for meetings. Sometimes...no, I've gone on Sand Hill Road a lot over the years because my prior employer's office is on Sand Hill Road, 2725 Sand Hill Road. And then I go to the Rosewood a lot which, as I said, didn't exist back then. And, again, what strikes me is just how incredibly developed it's now become. It's hard to get real estate there.

Stephen: Cool. Thank you.

Ruth: That's it?
