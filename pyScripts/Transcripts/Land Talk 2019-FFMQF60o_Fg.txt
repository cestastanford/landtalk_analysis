Interviewer: What place are you talking about?

Woman: Bloomington, Indiana. 

Interviewer: When did you move here?

Woman: When I was 13, in 1982.

Interviewer: What was Bloomington like back then?

Woman: A lot less apartments, and a little more rural areas. And it was safer. You could go downtown and not worry too much about getting in trouble.

Interviewer: How has it changed in landscape?

Woman: Again, there's a lot more apartments. Downtown, I think, is very crowded. A lot more restaurants. Some of the movie theaters downtown are gone. There were three movie theaters downtown...I think three movie theaters, and they're gone. And so, we used to be able to go downtown and watch movies. Can't do that. Obviously, one has been turned into a theater where they use for shows for older kids, I think, in Bloomington. I think it's either Stages or Cardinal. So, yeah.

Interviewer: What did you do with the kids, like activities?

Woman: If and when my parents would take me downtown, I could walk around downtown with friends. Or I could walk around campus. Campus is always beautiful, still. So, the IU campus, so i could do that.

Interviewer: Can you still do those activities? Or how have those activities changed?

Woman: You can do those activities. I think that safety is huge. I think that being aware of your surroundings is even more important now than it ever has been. But you can certainly do those activities. So yeah, you can still do it.

Interviewer: Do you think that Bloomington was better back then, or as it is now?

Woman: Ah, good question. I would like to think that we're getting better. I think some things might have been better, maybe, that we just, maybe... There's a homeless situation, I think, in Bloomington. And I don't know that we were aware of it back then, or maybe there wasn't so many. And that's different, and that would be nice to not have, but I know that's a bigger problem than just in Bloomington. I don't know, I like the way that it is now. It's good. 

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you.
