Interviewer: Hi, [inaudible 00:00:02] Los Lomitas School [inaudible 00:00:04] school used to look like?

Interviewee: Sure. I started teaching at Las Lomitas in 1988. And in 1988 Las Lomitas School was not as big as it is now, we didn't have the big two-story building that your classroom is in and we didn't have the big library building. So, it has changed a lot in the terms of how many students come here and how many buildings they are. 

Interviewer: How has Las Lomitas School look like now?

Interviewee: Las Lomitas School now is even growing more, there is construction trucks over there building more classroom buildings, to get portables removed so all the kids can be in a regular classroom and not have to be in portable buildings. So, I think it was much smaller school when I was there and now it's still growing. 

Interviewer: How has Las Lomitas School changed?

Interviewee: I think the biggest change is how many children are here, instead of about 300 children, there is over 500 children. Now that I have said, that's an important number, but one thing that hasn't changed is that Las Lomitas students and teachers are still having wonderful lessons and learning and enjoying school together. That has never changed. 

Interviewer: How has learning at school changed? 

Interviewee: I think the biggest change from learning at school from when I was a teacher here back in 1988 was technology. You have iPads, and microphones, and the internet, and all of these wonderful tools to take learning way out of the classroom and even maybe all around the world. We didn't even have phones in our classrooms at the beginning when I started teaching here. 

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing with us.
