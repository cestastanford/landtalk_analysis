Dan: What was most important to your parents?

Diane:  Well, I was in the dorm during the week and there was a phone call for me. So I went downstairs to answer it and it was Fred, calling and I didn't know who he was. But I had just broken up with another guy and I didn't have a date. So I said, "Sure I'll go out with you." Didn't know who he was but he turned out okay.

Dan: Well, how many children did you have?

Diane: We had four children.

Dan: And what makes you proud of your children?

Diane: I'm proud of my children because they all serve the Lord in their own way.

Dane: Well, what do you remember about me when I was born?

Diane: You?

Dan: Yeah.

Diane:  Well, I remember you were born in Hastings Nebraska. And dad wanted to name you Danny John, because he had a boy in his class at one time that was Danny John, and he loved the name. And I remember that you were a real good baby except when they first brought you home. That guys from church were putting a basement under our house and it was kind of dusty. And it was all dusty and you got a stuffy nose, woke up screaming and crying the first night you came home because you couldn't breathe.

Dan: That was not the best way to start out there.

Diane: No, but you got over it.

Dan: Well, what's your typical day like now? And how is it different then from what your daily routines were in the past?

Diane: Well, I get up. I wake up in the morning and I get up and get dressed and get ready for the day. And it all depends, some days I have meetings someday's I don't have meetings. In the winter I am not as busy as I am in the summer. In the summer I like to work outside in the flower beds and I plant tomatoes and flowers and I like to be outside working. And it's different because years ago when I had kids at home, I focused on the kids getting them ready for school whatever they needed to do I had to do. And I enjoyed it and I was glad to be a stay at home mom and I loved it.

Dan: Now what do you see as your place or purpose in life now?

Diane: One of the things I do is I go and visit the elderly and shut-in's every week. And I take them bulletins and CDs from our church. So that they can listen to the services and visit with them, and if they ask, I pray with them just checking out making sure they're taken well care off.    

Dan: And over time how have you changed the way that you look at life and at people?

Diane: Well, I look at people differently now. I look at people through eyes that ask what I can do for them, how I can help them in any way.

Dan:  Okay, that concludes the life history interview. And will now begin the history of place interview. This will be about the farm where you grew up. And you grew up there starting when you were about two years old?

Diane: Yap.

Dan: And the farm is still there nobody lives on it now. But you moved there in 1947, so you've got about 70 years of experience seeing how the farm has changed over the years. Okay, how long have you known about this place and what changes have you seen there over the 70 years?

Diane: I moved there when I was two years old. But I have a lot of memories of the farm being a really nice place. The house was well taken care of. There were some improvements made like there was a bathroom put in. Dad was one of those farmers that wanted his farm neat and clean. So that us kids took care of the yard, we mowed he raised hogs, he raised cattle we had chickens we butchered our own chickens, gathered our own eggs. Us kids had chore on the farm which was fine. All kids did at that time. We knew that we had to help out with feeding chickens and gathering eggs and watering hogs, feeding the livestock. We knew we had to help inside the house, we dusted, we cleaned, we did dishes. We did chores and that's the way we grew up because people worked together.

Dan: Good. Can you just tell me what you think about the Great Plains as far as our how culture, beliefs, values, how those are important to you and how it applies towards this region of the country?

Diane: Family is very important in the Midwest. And going to church, worshiping the lord that is very important. It always was important in our family.  And when I was kid growing up, all the families I knew went to church on Sunday mornings. Churches were filled on Sunday morning because there was nothing else open, there were no stores open on Sunday mornings.  And family life revolved around church and around family, it was a good way to grow up.

Dan: And to close just kind of summarize. What your childhood was like and contrast it to what you think that us being your kids what our childhood was like. And now what kids today how their childhood would be?

Diane: Well, we grew up knowing that if we want something we had to work for it. It wasn't just given to us. We worked hard, we saved our money and if we wanted something we had to ask Mom and Dad about it first. And they were good parents, they taught us to be responsible. They taught us that if you want something badly you need to work for it. I don't see a lot of that today. I see a lot of kids with their hands out expecting mom and dad to do the work and they reap the benefits of it getting what they want when they want. And if they don't they throw a fit.

Dan: Okay. Well, thank you very much. And this concludes the interview.
