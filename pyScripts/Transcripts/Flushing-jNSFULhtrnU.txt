Hello. This is Allison Fong. I graduated from law school back in 1989, and then I work for a small firm in New York City. And in 1992, I was still a pretty new attorney, and through the introduction of a mutual friend, I joined a legal practice that was started by my partner in Flushing. So we mainly practice in the area of real estate law. We were also the attorneys for Asia Bank and we did all the bank closings for them. Asia Bank was bought by Cathay Bank just a few years ago. 

At that time, Flushing had a bad rep. I felt that people looked down on lawyers who maintained offices in Flushing, other than in New York City, Long Island or Forest Hills in Queens. To me, it was still a diverse place with immigrants from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India, who wanted to live close to their relatives and open up small businesses. There were few good food choices...I mean, restaurant choices. Decors of restaurants, eateries, bakeries were plain and not very exciting. Compare with other towns, Flushing at that time still was moderately busy, especially at the major intersections like Main Street in Roosevelt Avenue. And Flushing was also getting its nickname as New York's Second Chinatown. Flushing has changed so much over the years. We have much more, much more, much more food traffic, car and bus traffic. The area is jammed all the times and the area is supercharged. We have a tremendous increase in the number of restaurants, fast food places, chain drugstores, groceries. Dozens of banks line up Main Street making Flushing one of the most important financial centers of New York. Essentially every bank wants to open a branch here

The popularity of Flushing has surpassed that of New York City's Chinatown. I was told by my clients that people from mainland China are now more interested in Flushing than in Chinatown. Luxury high rises, fancy mega-construction projects, restaurants with high-end decors, all transform the area into a global center. Flushing today also includes foreign Chinese buyers who want to invest in properties to rent out, empty nesters who want to downsize, and others who feel like it's just trendy to live here. The sense of community back in 1992 was more local in nature. Nowadays, Flushing is much more global. Investors can come from other Asian countries, and Western developers love to collaborate with the flushing developers. The sense of culture today is definitely much more rich and vibrant with choices and lifestyles that restructure the way we experience modern Flushing

As a practicing attorney, the uprising of Flushing has given me a big boost to my business. Traffic though can often be a problem especially during rush hours and also around the construction sites. The area's popularity has given it a great rep. Now it is considered to work and live in Flushing. The area has become a place where people can enjoy visiting with their families even on weekends as there are plenty of great restaurants and shops.
