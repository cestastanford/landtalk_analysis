Interviewer: What was the historic appearance? [German 00:00:37] 

Interviewee: Twenty years ago, there were much less people there, of course, and much older homes. So in 20 years, they built very...a lot of new homes because the population increased a lot and not so many cars on the street. Now, there are a lot of cars, a lot of pollution, a lot of congestion. Everything is getting more and more crowded.

Today there are so many different opportunities for people like big indoor parks, big, like, events happening, like, almost every weekend. Twenty years ago, there was not so much.
