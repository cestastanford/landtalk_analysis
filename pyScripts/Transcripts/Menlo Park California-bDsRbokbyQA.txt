Child: Hi. We are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. How has Las Lomitas School changed?

Woman: Las Lomitas School never used to have some portables. You see where Champions is right now?

Child: Yeah.

Woman: Champions used to be way over there. Maybe you even remember it, over in the corner. And then, they bought that property to expand and make Las Lomitas bigger for the kindergarteners. All the trees are taller, all the landscaping has grown in.

Child: Can you describe how Sand Hill Road used to look like?

Woman: Sand Hill Road, a long time ago... Hmm, let's see if I can remember. I don't think it was four lanes, and I know for a fact there weren't all those big, big, big, big tech companies, because, of course, technology is something brand new.

Child: What did Kepler's Bookstore look like in the past?

Woman: In the past, it used to be twice as big, But ever since Amazon started selling books, Kepler's has gotten smaller and smaller.

Child: Thank you for sharing with us.

Woman: Okay, bye.
