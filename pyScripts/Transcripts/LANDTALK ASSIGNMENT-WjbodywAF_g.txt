William: My first question for you guys is, I just want to know, the place we'll be talking about is Dallas, Texas where you guys are from, been for 20 years. How did this place look before in comparison from the last 20 years that you were there until now?

Female speaker: Well, Dallas? Let's see. Twenty years ago, they didn't have as... I think the biggest change in Dallas is all the uptown areas. Like, they have uptown around Lemmon, where we built the house in Kessler Park, it's kind of like an uptown area, they have bridges now. It's a little more hip-hop and for the young, whereas before it was like family-oriented, no hip-hop, no... What's that big hotel? The Zee...

Betty: Hmm.

Female speaker: No, what's the name of it?

Betty: W?

Female speaker: The W. Stuff like that didn't exist 20 years ago.

William: It's become a lot more urban.

Betty: And also the freeways, there are more freeways now in Dallas than there were 20 years ago.

William: Like, 35 and everything?

Betty: Freeways everywhere, they opened up a lot more freeways now that it was then.

Female speaker: Right. And subdivisions way out.

Betty: Yeah.

Female speaker: Yeah.

William: Perfect, perfect. Okay. So could you tell me how it... Well, you guys just answered how it's changed but like, and how it was like before. So I guess that... So in general you're saying it's become a lot more urbanized in the sense that it's changed like with more hip -op, a lot more night life for the younger kids, and it looks different in terms like the freeways that have been added and everything. You have a lot... 35 North has been built for a while. Could you tell me what are some of the things that you used to do there before, like, those 20 years before all those drastic changes occurred?

Female speaker: That's a good question. I guess we did just more, like a big thing way back then was the fair and movies and things like that. Now the big things are shopping and restaurants and the night life and, you know, just, and walking around this sort of uptown area and all that.

Betty: Yeah, we're good,

Female speaker: And golf, we golf more because we have more golf courses than we did way before. What do you think Betty?

Betty: Well, back then we were more like just going to each other's house and partying at each other's house because there wasn't no a lot of places to go. But now since the, you know, Dallas has grown a lot, it's more things to do, we don't have to go to each other's houses less frequently as we used to.

Female speaker: That's right. We meet out.

Betty: Now we can go out in the city and have a good time, and so there's different restaurants...

Female speaker: Shake it up baby. Shake it up baby

Betty: ...there's a whole lot more restaurants than it was back then.

William: Exactly. And so how do you guys... This is like my last final question for you, is like, how does it compare in terms of you enjoying it 20 years ago until now? Did the drastic change for you end up meaning that you liked Dallas a little bit less or...?

Betty: I think I like it a little bit more now compared to 20 years ago.

William: Yeah, a lot more things have opened up.

Betty: Got us into more shopping and more, because I like to shop, of course, and there's more restaurants, different restaurants, not the same old, boring Oak Cliff restaurants where you have to go there and have fried chicken every day. Whenever you want to go out for a good meal there's nowhere to go except for the hood or, you know? 

William: Yeah. 

Betty: But now, you have a broad amount of restaurants that you can go to, and different places, different areas in Dallas and have a really good time, enjoy the food there, the entertainment.

Female speaker: Yeah, I agree with Betty. It's more fun. It was fun then, I had fun then but I have just as much fun, and there's just more stuff to do now, you know. And now with Micah, you know, having a seven-year-old, they want to do everything. 

William: Exactly. 

Female speaker: So it's given more stuff for young kids, more... You know, there was soccer and football and all that then, but it's like triple, then, you know, awards and tournaments and everything.

William: Just a lot more engaging things.

Female speaker: Now it's more fun. I think now it's good, probably better. I agree with you, Betty.

Betty: Oh yeah, I think it's a lot better.

Female speaker: We're growing with the times baby.

William: Of course, that's what you got to do. All right, perfect. I love you guys. Thank you guys so much for helping me out.

Female speaker: All right. You're welcome. Love you too, William.

Betty: All right, Love you too, William.

William: I'll talk to you guys...

Female speaker: All right. Study hard. Study hard. Mwah.

William: Love you, bye.

Betty: Love you.

Female speaker: Bye.
