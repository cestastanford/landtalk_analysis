Hi, this is Wardlow Park in Long Beach. And 20 years ago I think probably the biggest change is probably the landscaping along the walkway. Let's go on down for a little walk. It used to be a lot more dense where the kids can get in and make little caves and hide in there and they really thinned this out, probably for security reasons.

Trees are pretty much the same. We've had a lot of these trees. The playground's changed. Let's go check out the playground. So one of the other big changes probably in the last 20 years is they remodelled the playground and made newer, nicer playground probably about 10 years ago, 12 years ago.  

And that's about it. Everything else is pretty much the same. We've had the same baseball fields at our local park, neighborhood park. Probably a few trees we've lost with some storms and we have seen we lost some trees. Spent many days playing with the kids over the years in the playground and coming and playing T-ball, and just we're bringing the dogs through. Still bring the dogs through, no more kids.

But yeah, other than that, climate-wise, crowd wise I think it's still the same. It's a nice neighborhood park.
