Steven: Hi everybody? I'm Steven and this is my land talk. So I'm going to be talking to my mom about a place that she remembers from growing up, that she still visits today. Okay, cool. So, mom, I guess first thing, can you just tell everybody your name, where you grew up and what place you remember from when you were young? 

Terese: Hi everyone? My name is Teres. and I grew up in Merced which is in the San Joaquin Valley of California, and I grew up going to Yosemite on day trips and also we would camp there as a family. So we spent a lot of time in Yosemite back in the 70s I remember going as a young girl and well into the 80s. Like the 70s and 80s and then now with our family, we go.

Steven: Nice, so about 30 years later? 

Terese: Yes, 30 years later, so it has changed a lot. 

Steven: Cool, so can you kind of describe to me what you remember most about Yosemite in the 70s and 80s like maybe like particular places that you go to or things that you see that you remember from back then? 

Terese: Yeah, when I was young we would go to the valley which is known as the Yosemite Valley and the valley has changed a lot over the last 30 years. I remember as a kid going and one particular hike we did it was called Vernal Falls and it's a very, very spectacular fall. And I remember as a kid just driving straight up to the bottom of the actual fall, and us just jumping out of the car and heading right onto the trailhead. And there weren't really good trail like protected trails so we could actually touch the water and just hike right up next to it and feel like we are part of the nature right there. Now, you can't park anywhere near the trailhead which is, you know, they set up parking kind of far away. 

One thing I do want to point out is back in the 70s, I think there were probably maybe a million visitors in Yosemite and now there's about 4 million plus visitors a year in Yosemite, so the amount of traffic between then and now you know, has increased significantly. So back then you could easily hop on any of the trails and there weren't very many people and it was very very, very clean and like I said, you could just touch the water and safety wasn't as big of an issue, I don't know whether people got smarter. Were smarter back then or not, or what the deal is that there were fewer people dying. Falling falls is a very dangerous fall, but the valley in general, there was just a lot that you could just park your car right there in the center of it and go take off on any hike on you want to do. And it was very clean and very pretty, it was easy. 

Steven: Yeah, more accessible for sure it sounds like 

Terese: Very accessible and you know, not a lot of railing and a lot of safety restraints that they have in place now. 

Steven: So you see more like railing on some of like the steep parts of the trails and like on some of the hikes, you mean like the waterfalls now? 

Terese: Yeah, now they've actually put railing in and you can still see of course, but you're far back from the actual waterfall to obviously to help prevent the deaths that have occurred from people falling in, but also I think that the parks do a great job educating the people, the visitors as they come into the park. Educating them about keeping the national park clean and not littering and carrying their trash out. I think that the park itself does a great job educating people but there's still the few that do leave their trash around and obviously with more traffic there's gonna be a lot more pollution and the air quality is obviously a big deal with all the cars coming into the park. 

So I definitely can see a change from when I was a visitor in the 70s and early 80s compared to now. Obviously, it's still gorgeous and it's still beautiful but in the valley, it's like so congested now with people on the trails, they're jam-packed there. They've like built-in steps and stairs to help you know, so everyone can go on it. It's not just for, you know, in shape hikers or whatever, like population can hike on them now. 

Steven: Families and staff.

Terese: So I guess that I mean that's a good thing, more people can see it. Changes aren't necessarily bad but it's very different. 

Steven: For sure. I can imagine it probably looks a lot different too. Awesome, cool. Well, thanks so much mom.

Terese: Okay, you're welcomed.

Steven: All right, bye-bye.
