Chris: Okay, would you mind first introducing yourself and the place that we're going to be talking about? 

Miguel: My name is Miguel Nobert Copello, and I'm talking about the Highland Park area where I grew up. I've lived there back in 1978 for about 20 years, but my parents still live there and I go back and visit every now and then. 

Chris: How did this place look when you first got there? Just in g-eneral. 

Miguel: When we first moved there, there were a lot of small stores, like individual stores run by families, small like little Mom and Pop shops. There were some little boutiques, there was a restaurant run by an Italian family and every time you went it seemed like you'd see the same people there, like every day. There was an old movie theater, some of the places looked they'd been there for like, you know, 30, 40, 50 years with no maintenance. So it was kind of a rundown area. There was a few stores over that time period when I lived there, there were a few stores that closed and it kind of became like abandoned storefronts, abandoned buildings, so it kind of started decaying over time and it seems like there was no money put in to it, no new infrastructure has been, this has went out of business, it just kinda stayed closed.

So it's kind of a decane neighborhood, a lower class, middle class, lower class blue collar. And so the only thing that really sustained the economy there was just I guess the small Mom and Pop shops but they didn't stay very long and no big companies came in to take over. It wasn't a very attractive place. 

Chris: How has the place changed since that time up until now? 

Miguel: Over the last, I would say maybe 10, 15 years, there's been I guess a little bit more gentrification in that area. So you see money being put into it. There's some nicer restaurants, some high-end restaurants, even some museums I think, yeah, I went to the museum there with my sisters not too long ago. Even the houses have changed like they seem to be more kept up, you could tell by just the renovations in the houses and the pricing of the houses. The pricing has definitely gone up even though there's still some abandoned storefronts, there seemed to be some real high-end boutiques or like I said, museums or high-end little more high-end restaurants coming in and you see that there are a lot more pedestrian friendly. 

There are more people walking in the area with the halls with families, which didn't happen very much when I was growing up. It seemed to be kind of abandon and not very lively. So on any weekend, you go there, you see families, kids, people going out and hanging out there. There are more places that attract kind of a younger crowd, young families. So it seems it's gotten little more expensive to live there. There's more investment and you're seeing even some high-end stores going up some big beer companies. I think there's a Trader Joe's that opened up recently. So, yeah, it's changed probably due to gentrification. 

Chris: So what are some of the things that used to do here growing up? 

Miguel: Go shopping at discount stores with my mom, there were a couple of stores that I remember that had like discounted clothes and discounted furniture. There was a movie theater that we used to frequent. It was old and kind of run down but it was the only one in the neighborhood. There was a park in the neighborhood too, that's still there. There were not very many restaurants. Like I said, there was only one that I remember where that was a family owned Italian little restaurant. 

There was, I think I like a Hispanic bakery where we would go to, but it was like a kind of Mom and Pops too, which is kind of a family owned. I guess that's about it. It wasn't like a place we hung out but we would go there when we needed to buy something or go to the movies or just maybe walk by there with my friends just because it was part of the neighborhood, but we didn't really hang out there too much. 

Chris: What about now? What are some of the things that you do there now?

Miguel: Just today I went to eat at a really nice high-end Mexican restaurant, which had a pretty diverse menu with a lot of even vegetarian options and special Margarita's and specialty drinks and specialty foods. The place was full, there was a waiting. There were families there, there were doggies there. My sisters go there often to the nice bakeries to buy cakes or bread for the family. There are museums, I went to a museum not too long ago there, which was unheard of back when I was growing up. It was featuring some of the new local artists. 

They have nights where also they close the streets and they do festivals to showcase some of the new businesses that have gone in and there's food trucks and they closed down the streets and I think a lot of the politicians, the mayor, and people come out and supported the neighborhood in that week. I think it's like a two-day thing. I mean that has changed, it used to be a little bit livelier, a lot more people, a lot more interest in the neighborhood. And I see new restaurants coming in and new stores coming in that tend to be a more high-end thing.

So with that comes higher prices and housing too. So the demographics have changed. It seems people that have moved in are young, younger yabeast [SP] I guess is what you come with family, they have higher income so they're outspending more and walking around more and they made it seem like very pedestrian friendly. So I've walked there with my sisters a few times and my dog and just kinda hung out in that area. There's a lot more, it seems like there's a lot more to do. 

Chris: I think that's all the questions I have. Thank you for taking your time to answer them. It's interesting to like hear about how these places have changed and how over time it seems that like path of development is kind of...

Miguel: I mean Chris a lot of neighborhoods around [inaudible 00:07:58] are turning that way. I see it little by little. Old town Pasadena, there was a lot of like homeless people there when I was in that area, like homeless and you know, just abandoned buildings for years. That was like the, you've been Old Town Pasadena, right?

Chris: Yeah. 

Miguel: It's just, yeah, well yeah, you did a school trip with, I forgot that but it was really run down and it was nothing there. It sucked. It was like security, you don't want to be there. Homeless people, it's kind of scarier I remember but it's happening in a lot of neighborhoods.

The same thing just you know, people are looking where to invest, where to want to put more, where to buy an inexpensive houses. So they started moving in those less expensive areas and then they start demanding more stuff like restaurants and high-end stores, so because they're getting priced out of the, the expensive areas in L.A are too expensive. Anyway. All right, hope that helps.
