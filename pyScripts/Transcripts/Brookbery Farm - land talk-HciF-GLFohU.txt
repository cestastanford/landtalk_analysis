Interviewer: What areas, in the Winston-Salem area, do you found have changed significantly over your time here in the last 20 plus years?

Interviewee: Well, I think one of the areas that's changed the most was a farm...site of a farm that was a little bit outside of Winston-Salem, closer to an area called Louisville, which was originally a working cattle farm that later was sold as a real estate venture to convert into a series of home and townhomes and staged events. So that area became developed into a large number of family...different sized family homes.

Interviewer: And how long do you think it took for that change to kind of happen from the farm to this now development?

Interviewee: Well, it was talked about for probably two or three years. But by the time when it was actually...the deal became reality and it actually started to be developed, it probably took a couple years before the first wave of homes were developed. And then from that first phase and even up to now, there's been a series of still...they're still developing some parts of the farm. So there have been stages of several kinds of homes going in over time.

Interviewer: And what about the area around surrounding this new housing development has changed?

Interviewee: I think there's been a noticeable development in increased traffic just because of the number of families that you have living out there now. Two new schools were built that were...a large high school and then a middle school...elementary school were built out in the area. And also a sizable commercial business area with a grocery store, McDonald's, and some strip shopping was built to service all those homes and the new people living out in that area.

Interviewer: And the kind of traffic that has been created by all these different changes, and the development, and then the ensuing school and commercial real estate market, how do you think that has impacted the people in the area, the people that were already there and, you know, positively or negatively?

Interviewee: Actually, probably those that were living there were living in homes that had a fair amount of space...yard space to each house. So it wasn't very populated at that point. So the increased population from the new homes, it has definitely dramatically increased traffic in...especially rush hours as people are accessing the highway and some of the busier roads systems from that area. A noticeable backed up traffic in the mornings for school time hours. It's probably definitely been an inconvenience for those that live there when it was much less populated. And...
