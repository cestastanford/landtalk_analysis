Interviewer: Hi, Papa. Here we go. So, first of all how long have you lived in Fort Myers Beach?

Interviewee: So, 20 years.

Interviewer: 20 years? So, you said that earlier that you had a condo and then you got the house.

Interviewee: First, a condo on the beach, and then we bought this house, so we had two properties here. And then, about three year ago, we sold the condo and we are now here on the back bay which is the back bay is actually the Matanzas...what they call Matanzas Bay.

Interviewer: That's awesome. Basically, what this interview is gonna be about is just like changing...like, visible changes kind of in the landscape or like the oceans and also just regarding what species of animals. So first of all, have you, like, noticed visible changes in the landscape basically whether it's like the beach or in that preserve that you mentioned?

Interviewee: Well, first, the beach is in the other side so that's when we bought…have the condo at that time. So the beach, they had widen it...what they call it, beach refresher where they dug the sand and then brought it to the shore because it was being eroded and taken by the sea. In that way, they artificially enlarged the beach and that has been the case and it's been holding good. So, about three, I think it's about 3 miles away, they wanted a very clean sand so it's beautiful sand. It's white. They re-nourished the beach. So that's one of the changes that has occurred. It's very nice, but only on the north side of the island. They did not refresh going from the mid-island to the south, which is going towards Bonita Beach or Bonita community. And the other thing that happened is that on the bay side, they have also drenched the opening to the Gulf of Mexico because that's where the coast guard, and extreme boat, and the big boats are able to come in through the bay. So, those are the changes. The other changes that we noticed for these past 20 years is that there's a lot of use of this channel in front of our house or in front of our, you know, Matanzas beach house which is actually, it's a bay house, it's on the bay, that there's a lot of boat, recreational boat and bigger boats including the Key West Express which is the one where it takes people because it's better to take the Key West Express, it's only three hours ride whereas if you drive from here to Key West, it will take probably seven hours because you have all the traffic and also it's a very narrow lane going all the way to the end, the Key West. So, other changes is that there's an island in the middle of the bay and that is really enlarging our mangrove and so, the Bird, as we call it the Bird Island. So, those are the major change. And then, of population and growth, you know. People are coming down. So that's basically… You know, this traffic is tremendous because there's only one way to reach Fort Myers Beach and there's one bridge. That's the only bridge. The other bridge is on the end, south end going towards Naples. But that's not used as much in coming into the beach because most of the activities and the beach, you know, is very accessible by this bridge alone, one bridge. It doesn't cost anything whereas Sanibel which direction's only 20 minutes away, you have to go through the causeway and it costs $6 to drive through and go to Sanibel Island.

Interviewer: Wait, so Papa, I have a quick question. So, I remember, like, whenever I come down, I'd always see outside of your house, like, a lot of plants whether it's flowers or you had a lot of fruit trees. Is that correct? Has that been there the whole time you were there or do people come in and plant those?

Interviewee: Yes. Oh, a lot of them, there's what they call Make Fort Myers Beach Green. So they sell the beach or club pier, they have trees and they encourage people to use native plant to plant in their yard, whatever, to make it more green around here. So, there's more trees, nice, a lot of palm trees and it is all intended to make it look greener and more aesthetic, and, you know, beautiful area to look at. And the road has been improved in the north end and now it's being improved now. It's been working on it all the way down to the south end. Fort Myers, this is only 7 miles length and the width is different sizes, and you go, it's only maybe about, like here in the north end, it's only about less than maybe 500 yards. No, more than that, more than that. 500 yards, so you can reach it. So maybe about 1,000 yards from our house from the bay to the beach, to the Best Western, the beach. It's only about 10 minutes walk.

Interviewer: Wow, that's awesome.

Interviewee: So, it's very narrow. In other areas, it's wider.

Interviewer: Definitely. And just my last question is, like, so you've always loved to fish, like, have you noticed any changes in the amount of fish or the type of fish that you've seen throughout your years living in Fort Myers Beach?

Interviewee: The water that we have been fishing, you know, if you don't... If I just fish off our dock here, I will be catching redfish, we caught catfish but we throw it away, and then we also catch mangrove snapper, which is a smaller sized snapper. And there is what's called the snook. Snook is a special fish that has a marking on the side and it's not commercially available. You can only…have to catch it and then they have a limit about how long the size of this fish before you can keep it. If it's too small, you have to release it. If it's too big, you have to be releasing it. The size should be not less than, I think, 27 inches and not more than 37 inches. The reason why you can't keep more than 37 inches is that supposedly these are bisexual fish. When they grew to a big one, they are mostly female fish so they spawn. They have little baby fish. So, that's just called snook, snook fish. What other fish do we have? We have what's called the sheephead. They have marking on the side. They look like prison uniform so they call it... So that was a sheephead.

Interviewer: Have you noticed, like...

Interviewee: These are all available at that time and catch them quite a few, and whenever I fish, then I fill up my freezer and then Jamie [SP] said, "You can't catch anymore fish because you have so much in your freezer. You have to finish them all before you can catch again." So anyway, that's what they used to be but now, just in the last, maybe a year, the red tide came and you see them back, a big brouhaha here, big news because it has... This red tide is an algae problem. It grows. This kind of algae, it produces a toxin and if they inhale, it causes respiratory ailments, it causes coughing. Not only that, it kills a lot of fish.

Interviewer: Definitely. That's scary. 

Interviewee: Yeah. And they have here and you could see the whole beach is covered with fish, and when they are drying up, it stink. This happened maybe last year. The whole summer of last year, they have problem. They have so much fish, ton full. It starts from almost to Tampa to the whole…it went to Marco Island. All beach are all...it used to be only segmental, you know, a small segment. They have this tide, red tide we call it because it's a toxin, it's an algae and they produce this toxin that causes respiratory ailment. It also causes some skin condition and people... The fish has now not returned yet because they are all dead. So, we think, they said it will be another maybe the whole summer and whole spring next year when the fish will be abundant again. I see some few, with my spotlight, snook but very rare. Also, the dolphin, they are playing around in front of our yard...of our house in the back bay, I have seen only three or four of them. [crosstalk 00:11:15]

Interviewer: Oh, wow. That's so sad. That was my favorite part about coming down is seeing the dolphins.

Interviewee: Because of this red tide, a few died. They have also manatees that died. They were in the beach because the manatees only get out of their location and were near the electric plant where they produce...because it's warmer water. They like warm water. So, when it is cold water, they will not come out there but when it's warm, summertime, they'll come out and they will be seen all over the place, in our canals, in the back bay, and the whole shebang. Some of the manatees, a special type of mammals… It's a fish who like to swim. But quite a few of them died. Then the other thing is even the dolphin, there was one or two that died that was laying on the beach dead. That was because of that algae, that red algae. So, the tourists did not come. A lot of the tourists have not returned because as I said there are still some remnants of it and they are now making all kinds of preparation to prevent it. They blame it on the water system coming from the lake in the middle part of Florida called the… What do I call it now? The lake is called Okeechobee. Big O. That's a big lake and the watershed is coming all the way from Kissimmee, Orlando, the whole thing. And there are tributaries there, they are dripping down towards the water, the big lake, the Big O. And then, during the early times, the way the... While the fish were all good and everything was fine, it's because Florida, half of the…almost one-fourth of the whole state of Florida was uninhabited because of the flooding at that time and a lot of people cannot plant anything because of the yearly rainy season, hurricane, all of that, that floods. So, even water goes down all the way to Miami and to the Everglades, and that was needed. By the time it travels down, all the pollutions at that time were clean but they can't plant anything. So what they did, they dammed the lake and make the water retain in the lake and the corps engineer have controlled the release of water. One of the major area that they... So all those that are flooded before in water, cannot plant anything become now agricultural land. And so, thousands of acres of land were converted. That's why Miami, Fort Lauderdale, part of the Everglades, they become all agricultural and some of them, they raise cows and, you know, all kinds of hogs and pigs and... So, it becomes now... And so, because they now control the water, but the problem is when there is too much rain, they have to release the water because it will flood. And in fact the dam that they had made was destroyed one time when there was too much water in the big lake. So, they now release this water when it comes to a certain level and pour it towards the river called Caloosahatchee River that goes to Fort Myers to Sanibel Island, that's where it goes to the Gulf. So, that's the problem, what we're having. The other area that they release is going towards St. Lucie which is on the west going to the Pacific, to the Atlantic Ocean.

Interviewer: Interesting.

Interviewee: And so, those are the…the way remedied it and they made all the lands south of the big lake becomes now owned by sugarcane companies. They planted sugarcane. The cities down there improved, and so you have Fort Lauderdale, you have Palm Beach, you have Daytona Beach, and all those that used to be very few land that are available but became now populated because they like the beach and they like the sun. And now, there is a lot of land. It's very cheap, 25 cents an acre in the beginning.

Interviewer: Oh, wow. That is very cheap.

Interviewee: That's how the big companies were able to buy 700 acres of land for sugar. But now, they changed and instead of flowing down to the Everglade, it's flowing down to these three tributaries that they have created to release the water. Well, what happened is that this water that goes to the lake does not stay there very long. It's polluted by potassium, nitrogen, and fertilizer, you know? It becomes polluted and they release it and that's where they believe is the cause of the algae bloom, the red tide.

Interviewer: That's very interesting.

Interviewee: Right. So, it is the history of this Florida is really mostly swamp, swamp land. There are wet farms, they call it wet farms because during summer, it rains, then for a short time, they will be able to plant there because it's all barren land. Grass is the only one that is...that's why Everglades is full of grass. But if they don't release too much water from the lake, the saltwater goes to the Caloosahatchee River upward and it destroys the mangrove with the little fish, all kinds, oysters and all are destroyed. They have to maintain the salinity of the river similar to the time, in the olden days when the flow of water goes to the Everglade. So, it's a balancing act. During rainy season, too much water, they release it. It destroys the oyster beds, the duck grass where the fish spawn and have little babies and all of these are all, you know, swept down to the Gulf of Mexico. So, it's a balancing act that they have to do.

Interviewer: Definitely.

Interviewee: So now, they wanted to maintain a certain salinity. They know how much should be released in order to maintain that standard salinity for the fish and the oyster, and everybody will be happy. And where do you put the water when there's too much water in the lake? This is the big question that they are going to solve. They're going to release it in a pond but the pond can only…you know, it's a retaining pond. They bought some land from those who bought it a long time ago and they create a pond, like a big pool of water. But that's only about 40% and they allow the water to stay there, and supposedly all the bad nutrient like the nitrogen and whatever comes from when you fertilize are supposed to go down and seep through the Earth and it will cleanse itself before going to the Atlantic Ocean or to the Gulf. But the problem there is it is not that efficient. It has to be spread in a big swathe of wetland. So they have to release the water to those farm that's already been prepared for planting so they can get the efficiency back to get rid of the toxin in order to... This will not allow the algae to grow again because the algae is the one dependent on those fertilizer, things that we use to make our grass grow. Some people don't even have septic system that are as efficient. It pollutes the water that's going to the Lake Okeechobee. So, that's the problem that they have. They want clean water now. America is so great in technology. They know exactly what's happening and they want to simulate the old ways. You spread it so they have to take back about 100,000 acres, to ask the farmers to give up and recycle that, give up that number out of how many thousands of acres of land, and then the next time they will switch it to other places to make it like a filtering wetland before it goes to the big body of water, the Gulf of Mexico or to the Atlantic Ocean or down to the Everglades. And so, that's what the…that's the story of all this business of clean water is needed.

Interviewer: That was awesome, Papa. Thank you. You seem very knowledgeable about this subject. I love that.

Interviewee: You love that?

Interviewer: Yeah. But that's all the questions that I have for you today so thank you so much for agreeing to the interview.

Interviewee: Yeah, so now, you said, "No, no. [inaudible 00:21:42] are not good now." They have to come back. They have to come back because there were a lot of them dead. [crosstalk 00:21:49] place, or you should see a ton full of fish on the beach.
