Interviewer: How did this place look before? 

Interviewee: Well, the place we're talking about here is Lemon Heights, California. It's part of the city of Tustin. And before it used to just be rows and rows of lemon trees, some grapefruit trees, occasional avocado, lots of eucalyptus trees were planted as windbreakers or wind barriers. So I guess about 100 years ago and as well as some cedar trees. Regarding the animal life, you know, it was kind of diverse. You know as a kid playing around and hearing stuff, you know, you would see coyotes, there were lots of them, mountain lions, bobcats, all pretty plentiful. Always in the summer, we had to worry about snakes, rattlesnakes, definitely. And lots of birds, it was always, you know, fun place to go.

Interviewer: How has it changed since then?

Interviewee: Well, the landowner sold all the land to builders. So basically they've pretty much clear-cutted everything. They've put in a freeway that goes through part of the area. They've cut down virtually all the citrus trees, there are some, occasionally, that are left in little groves to, I guess, bring back the old feeling of what it used to be like here. You know there's even a park called Citrus Grove park where they, you know, left some of the lemon trees. Regarding the animals, it's interesting though. The animals, the coyotes, still are around and a lot of the neighborhoods they hire people to round up the coyotes and take them away but it's a foolish task because they always come back. There are mountain lions and I, in the last, I say, 10 years we've seen one bobcat ourselves. There are still lots of rattlesnakes surrounding the area and, you know, I think there are a lot fewer birds though. But you know with respect to the animals it seems like it, really, even though they brought in all these houses until we developed it I still think a lot of the animals here remain. They have not left.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you used to do here?

Interviewee: Well, we used to hike around here a lot. It was since...it was owned by one landowner, they had the area fenced off with, you know, the three strands of barbed wire fencing and you know really hadn't changed for like the last 100 years and so we would climb over, go under the barbed wire, and also in this area there were some really neat caves in the side of one of the mountains just some sandstone caves and such. And it's interesting when they develop the houses, of course, you know they demolished all the caves. They pretty much moved mountains, and hills, and everything else. But you know we used to camp here and hike and it was really a great way to spend the day unless, of course, you know we were dodging the patrols with the landowner that didn't want anybody trespassing. But you know dodging those guys was kind of fun too in hindsight.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you do here now?

Interviewee: Pay property taxes, raise kids, I live in a house here now. You know it's kind of funny, you know, I now look at the area that I used to play as a kid and now you know I'm raising my kids here but they don't have our surrounding environment that I got to enjoy, you know the... And now it's just all suburbia where it goes houses upon houses. And you know they did save some areas to make a nice regional park in the area which I think you know that's something that is enjoyable to take the kids to see. But an experience, but you know you don't have the vastness that you used to have. And, of course, there's a lot more traffic and everything else. But even though we have all those things it's still kind of interesting that we live in an area that people are afraid to have their cats out at night or their small dogs running out because you know they'll disappear from the wildlife and such. So we brought a lot of suburbia here, but still the natural animals have remained and they still pretty much control a lot of the outside activities you do.
