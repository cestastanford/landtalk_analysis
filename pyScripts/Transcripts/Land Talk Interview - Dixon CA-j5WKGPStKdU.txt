Interviewer: So, can you tell me a little bit about the place you want to talk about today?

Interviewee: I wanted to talk about the home ranch of my parents who were farmers in Dixon, California from 1961 all the way into the 1990s. And the changes that occurred in the land during the time when they gave up the land and now it's developed outside of Dixon.

Interviewer: Okay. So, how did Dixon used to look?

Interviewee: Dixon used to be a community of about 4,500 people when I was young. So, it was quite small and it was surrounded by farmland all the way around. And my parents owned a piece of land that was north of Dixon, off of Dixon's First Street. And it was a 200 acre home ranch which included land that ran all the way back to a railroad tracks, so, that was the back limit of our property. And when I was growing up it looked vast. I don't think in my lifetime I had ever walked all the way to the end of the property because it was quite large. And during a certain period of time they sold 10 acres of it and they put up a gas station area on it, but other than that the land was used for farming. It had crops that were rotated through it, so, often times we had tomatoes, we had sugar beets, we had field of corn, we had pink beans, and we had wheat. And the wheat was especially fun because after they harvest it and got the straw from the wheat, they would bale it up and then we would walk all the way into the fields to where they had it all piled and we would make forts out of the bales of straw and climb up on it, and that was a lot of fun.

Interviewer: Okay. And how has Dickson changed?

Interviewee: Well, now Dickson has about a population of about 12,000 to 14,000 people and you have to put them somewhere. The location of my father's property, however, was zoned for industrial. And so, when it came the time where my parents were going to retire from farming and this was around 1990, the property was sold to a developer. And so, basically it went from being a little homestead where there was three houses on it and 200 acres behind it. To now, it's pretty much an industrial park. And the site where my parent's home used to sit is now a great big Healthcare Supply Warehouse. And there are several other businesses that built warehouses and very big buildings on the area that used to be the 200 acres my parents owned and farmed.

Interviewer: Okay. And what did you used to do in Dixon?

Interviewee: Well, because it was our field, it was a very nice area to just roam around, it was working land. So basically, there were always, you know,  tractors that were disking and workers that were irrigating. And most of the land that I helped to work on wasn't generally our home ranch because we had a total of about 3,000 acres that were spread around in different communities around Northern California. But the home ranch, it was a fun place to explore because it had all the shop and all the tools and everything. It was very interesting to see a working farm and what was required to make the land productive. And we'd wake up in the morning sometime with a crop duster, dusting the fields. And so, we'd have to run out and grab our laundry from the line and bring it inside because it's not good to get dust all over you. And so, it was nice to have that space and the fact that you could use that space to earn money. As a farmer it was very valuable, it was really good land, it was fertile. And I kind of wish more farmland would not go under development because it is prime area where you could grow things.

Interviewer: Okay. And what do you do now in Dixon?

Interviewee: Well, in Dixon, now we go by to visit where the home ranch was. It's basically a parking lot with the large buildings on it. So, it employs a lot of people which is good for the economy there. However, it's just sad to see the loss of farmland and the vast spaces, but of course that's progress. People need to have a place to work, they need a place to live. It's just sad that so much farmland has gone out of production because that's the easiest place to build is where it's nice, and wide-open, and clear, and flat. And the more difficult places to build oftentimes aren't ideal for people to live in either because most of the land that has been developed for agriculture where the places that were flat and you're able to, you know, clear it out and it was easily accessible to water and other things. So, personally, I don't live in Dixon anymore, but the community is much larger and it has a lot more traffic, a lot more people around it, and it's basically mostly a bedroom town because a lot of people live there, but they don't necessarily work there. So, the fact that there is an industrial park where my parent's ranch was is good because it supplies jobs to the people there.

Interviewer: Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time.

Interviewee: Okay. Thank you.
