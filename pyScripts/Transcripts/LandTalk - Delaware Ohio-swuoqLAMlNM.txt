Yeah, I think we've lived here about 40, 41 years. And that was just grass growing and weeds when we moved out here. And there was formerly a tree that grew in the middle of my flower garden. What kind of a tree was that, that that John, we cut it down? Cherry tree? It was a wild cherry tree. And through the years, of course, it was old and everything, and died, and we cut it down. And then behind it, we planted this little pine tree and I'm trying to...it was a tree-like. And we have the hazard out here, of deer eating things, but fortunately, they didn't seem to eat that tree. At least not yet. And it seems to have thrived and grown. And...

...By us mowing these weeds. Because we planted a house, so there was a lot of, you know, mud and dirt around, in the beginning. And then we had to put the driveway in first. We put in a gravel driveway so that we could get the trucks up here to deliver like the traces for the roofs and different articles that we needed for the construction, and later on stone because we added stone to our pouch later on. But during the years, we formed a circle out front, and by mowing that...and we don't really fertilize it or put any kind of insecticide on it or anything, or herbicide because of the fact that we have animals...we also always had dogs and usually a cat or two. One cat at a time. That area has weeds in it, but you can't tell it so much because we keep it mowed and also the deer come out there and eat the grass in the circle. 

...Plant them after Christmas. And so we've planted quite a few trees out here over the 40, 41 years we've lived here. I'm sure it's probably over 100 of various kinds because we've planted them from seedlings. So we got... Ago, we had to put our insecticide around our house, around the foundation, over our house for a few years. But I mean, as far as like out where the deer would be eating the grass and that...  

...And more things that will be food for the monarch butterflies. There are certain kinds of milkweed that they will lay their eggs in. I wanna get more like a butterfly bush to encourage butterflies just to come around. I love butterflies. I love hummingbirds. And they like flowers that have big trinker, like a trink flowers that they can get their long beak into. And you know I feed the hummingbirds out on the front porch. I have two different feeders, which I'm gonna have to put out in a couple of more weeks because they will be coming back. I think in late April, they'll start...
