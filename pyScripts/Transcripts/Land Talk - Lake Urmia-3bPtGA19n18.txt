Interviewer: How would you describe the way this place used to look?

Interviewee: So it was known as, or it's even right now known as the largest lake in Italy, and also one of the saltiest lakes in the world. It was one of the main, if not, the only tourist attraction in my city. And it used to attract a lot of people to just come and see it. I think it started to dry out when I was 5. Am I going too far? Maybe it's another question?

Interviewer: It's actually leads to the next one. How did this place change?

Interviewee: So yeah, I think I was like 5 when I noticed that it was starting to dry out and the salt keeps getting more visible around it. The water was shrinking, and all you could see when you were passing by was starting to be just salt. And it wasn't really bad until I was like maybe 10 or 12, but by that time, you could just go very far to the lake and still it was just salt. I don't know how many percent exactly but I think more than 80% of it's dried out. It's just significant for a lake.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do in that area?

Interviewee: So as I said it's just like...it's a lake, people swim, used to swim. It's impossible now to swim. It's been impossible to swim for so long because of the salt. It literally cuts your skin. It's so like very thick layers of salt. So yeah, it used to be a place tourists used to come, but now they don't. And one of the like main consequences that it's brought about that's really horrible is like my city is really prone to winds. So when it's like wind, the wind brings the salt into the city and it makes it really difficult to breathe. It hurts the eyes like a salt goes into your eyes when it's really windy and it hurts. 

And one of the things that...there were like a lot of different organisms...that I have to look up, if you want. In the sea, in the lake, almost all of them disappeared. Two main kinds of birds disappeared, and one fish species disappeared. And there's one bird, like the only organism that's remaining from the sea, they are living in the rivers of the city now. There are probably 10 or 20 of them left. And no one's doing anything to preserve them. 

Interviewer:  Right. [inaudible 00:03:44]. Thank you so much for your time.
