Interviewer: So hello, Maria. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind if I asked you a couple questions about Nevada City, how it looked like before. How long have you lived here?

Maria: I've been living here in Nevada City for about 21 years.

Interviewer: Okay, okay. Have you enjoyed your time in Nevada City in those 21 years?

Maria: Absolutely, I have enjoyed it a lot. This is a beautiful place. We have a lot of forests. And it's pretty much a quiet town. When it comes to education, we have schools that have a very good education, especially here in Nevada City. And I just enjoy being here.

Interviewer: Awesome, that's good. I've enjoyed my time in Nevada City as well. So the first question that I'd like to ask is how did this place look before?

Maria: Well, when I moved here, like I said, 21 years ago, the Nevada City wasn't as diverse as it is now. It was mostly Caucasians that live in this town. Right now we have, it's becoming more diverse in our cultures and races. One thing that I remember clearly is that when my oldest daughter was in first grade in school, so first grade to eighth grade, she was the only Latina in the classes. And now I hear a lot from other people saying that the schools have become much more diverse than they used to be. Some of the things that have changed is there's a lot of city surrounded by forests. But now you can see more houses, people building more houses. A lot of people from the Bay Area are moving to this place because they like how beautiful and quiet it is. And that's all I can say for that.

Interviewer: Okay, so you, like, touched on it very briefly. But looking at how it's been in your, like, last 21 years, how has Nevada City or how has the area changed?

Maria: Of course like in every city, you know, development always happens. One of the things that I think I'm impressed the most since I came through Nevada City is that we didn't have any traffic lights. And I think four years ago, five years ago, they put their first traffic light. So that also means really that we've been changing to become, not more modern but becoming more like a city than just a small town, that Nevada City's becoming more like a city than just a small town.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. How do you feel about that, I guess about that change? From what I understand it's, like, an old mining town to more of a city.

Maria: Yeah, that's the other thing. It was an old mining town. So the way I feel about the changes, I think I like changes in the sense that when changes are positive making a community better I like it. I would love very much for Nevada City to stay like this. So if it's possible to keep it the way it is now and not to make it much more trafficky or populated that would be great. But I like it the way it is right now.

Interviewer: You mentioned the area and the demographics. Have those changed at all?

Maria: Yes, the demographics change. I think one of the reasons that it changed, it was because you know during the market crash in 2008...

Interviewer: Right.

Maria: ...a lot of the houses became available. A lot of houses became available because they were foreclosure. So that meant that low income and middle families were able to buy houses around here because the houses were much less expensive than they were before. From that point on, the demographics change because before 2008, what I saw, it was more people who, older people who had retired from other places, much bigger cities then they came here. So on the market crash, when housing became more affordable, middle-class families with children came here. So now there's a lot more families than just older couples.

Interviewer: Oh okay, cool, that's interesting. Kinda changing gears here. What are some things that you used to do in Nevada City and in the area?

Maria: Well, some things that I used to do was going on the trails for walks. Since we have a lot of forests and we have also the Yuba River, you're now easily able to go for a walk and enjoy nature. I used to do that. I've been doing that since 20 years ago and I'm still able to do that. And that's something that I enjoy. And other than that, you know, just working and doing the same routine that I do every day. So I like the same but what I enjoy the most is just going for walks on one of the trails here in Nevada City. We have many trails, [inaudible 00:08:07] Trail. That's something also very noticeable here in Nevada City, that you see a lot of people working and enjoying nature because we have, like, maybe eight or nine trails to go for a walk, or biking also.

Interviewer: Okay, that's all. What are some things that you do here now?

Maria: That I see now?

Interviewer: Yeah, or that you enjoyed to do. I know that Nevada City has a lot of local traditions. Having grown up here I know that personally...

Maria: Yeah, all the things that I do now that I still enjoy, somebodys had an idea of selling fresh vegetables in town. And it's call, I don't remember what it's call. But anyway, every Saturday, a lot of the people who grow their own vegetable they go on this specific street that is near Broad Street. And Broad Street is the main street in town and they sell all the vegetables. And all those vegetables are organic. So I enjoy going every Saturday when I can and buy vegetables. That's the other thing that I enjoy doing.

Interviewer: Oh, okay, great. Well, those are all the questions that I have for you regarding Nevada City. Is there anything else you'd like to add about it or you'd like to talk about?

Maria: One thing that I would like to add is that it is important for me to maintain the forest because that's one of the things that makes this place so beautiful.

Interviewer: Right.

Maria: And last year, probably last year, when we had the drought we had a difficult time with the forest population because there was a bark beetle... We had like an epidemic bark beetle attacking all the trees. And it was sad to see that. But luckily, like I say, when I work on the trails now I can see that it's getting better because it's been raining a lot. And I just hope that we'll continue caring and gardening all the forest that we have around here.

Interviewer: Great, awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. And yeah, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom on Nevada City.

Maria: Thank you so much for giving me time to talk about this beautiful place. Thank you so much.

Interviewer: All right, take care.

Maria: You too, bye.

Interviewer: Bye.
