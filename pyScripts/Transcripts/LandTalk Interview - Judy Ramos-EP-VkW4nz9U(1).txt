Elizabeth: Hello, my name is Elizabeth Spaith. And I am interviewing Judy Ramos, and this is a professor and Ph.D student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Alaska Native Studies and Rural Development Department. Thank you so much for letting me talk to you today. 

Judy: All right. Thank you. 

Elizabeth: All right. So I just want to start off by asking how long that you've lived in Alaska? 

Judy: Most of my life, except for maybe, like, 10 or 11 years where I lived in Canada from maybe the '90s. During the '90s I lived in Canada. 

Elizabeth: All right. And since you've been living there, what environmental changes have you witnessed occur in the area? I know we hear a lot about, like, melting glaciers but what exactly have you seen? 

Judy: Well, in my area, I live in Southeast Alaska, and we've gotten a lot more mudslides or landslides. The area where I live up by the glacier, there's an area that we camp out and on the corner of the glacier and that couple of years ago was a big mudslide and [inaudible 00:01:16]. They were building some houses. That was another area where there was a mudslide. I can't remember for sure but I think there were people in there. So those are just some of the changes. There's been a lot of increasing heavier rain. The rain has gotten a lot more intense.

In other parts of Alaska, up North, the northern people have experienced increasing erosion along the coast, melting of permafrost. The interior has gotten a lot more fire. There's been a couple of summers with really intense fire, storms...well, not storms but a lot more fires than we've seen in the hotter temperatures. Those are some of the areas. And also, I think the warming temperatures in the water, there is some effects to the shellfish losing their shell. And I think there's been some changes with the salmon, some of the salmon are either coming back late or early, and then some of the salmons are not really coming back, like, our king salmon haven't been coming back. 

And I think there's been a change with the fish up in the colder...they are heading towards the colder waters. So some parts of Alaska with the colder waters have gotten a lot more of the salmon than they got in the past. And there's been changes with the plants with those salmonberries. There's been changes with our berries, there are changes in the timing of when they do come and if they even do come. So those are just some of the changes that it's been happening in Alaska. 

Elizabeth: And so I assume that these changes are having a lot of direct effects on the residents of Alaska, in particular in your area. 

Judy: Yeah. There are areas that haven't gotten...just seen cold temperatures. Rivers are traditionally in the winter was a place where they could use the rivers, like rivers, like roads, so now the rivers are not freezing up. So they've lost that way of transportation on the rivers. Some winters, there's been enough inner snow for us to run our sled-dog racing. There's been some cancellations of some of our sled-dog races because there's no snow on the ground. I did a trail [inaudible 00:04:28]. There was some parts of the trail that they didn't have any snow at all.

For some of the people that have to hunt along the rivers, there's been increasing dangers for the hunters crossing the rivers. And this made them dangerous for hunting. Some of the people have had to go further away than they usually do to get food. So it's expensive and harder to get some foods. They have to go further away. Boy, they get...the food is [inaudible 00:05:12] change. 

So those are some of the changes. There's melting permafrost, in the North has caused the sellers that people use the ground to keep their food frozen and with the sellers melting. They can't put the food in there and there's increasing changes with activity and other things. So it's made it dangerous for them to use the traditional winter ground where they would freeze things in those areas. So those are just a couple of the changes that's impacted people directly for their food gathering and subsistence uses. 

Elizabeth: And so did these environmental changes affect, like, what field you wanted to get your Ph.D in, or kind of what you wanted to study or ultimately go into? 

Judy: Well, there's a couple of areas. One of the areas that I research is devotion of ecological sites along the coast. So I've been looking at monitoring those evolution with the other groups that are looking around the state where some sites have started eroding. And there's been no protection for some of the archaeological sites. So that's one area. 

I've been studying the seals, the harbor seals, so we're keeping an eye on to see if there's been any climate changes with our seals. There was one summer where they were getting these weird patches on them and we didn't know what it was. And later on, we found out that the seals were getting a sunburn on their skin and that's caused their unusual patches with the increasing melting of ice. That's the traditional places where the seals would gather and have their yen [SP] on the ice. 

That was a form of protection against the killer whales, but with the ice melting, there will be less ice for the seals to have their pups on. So that was a concern with less ice for the seals. So that was something that we were training, monitoring, keep an eye on in that area. 

Elizabeth: And if you could just briefly just remind me where exactly in Alaska you're seeing these changes or where exactly you primarily lived throughout the course of your life? 

Judy: I probably lived in southeast Alaska and my community as a Kodiak Attack, and it's at the Northern Panhandle with the North Gulf Coast part of Alaska. So it's along the coast, but we have a big huge bay, which it's like a big glacier that used to be all the way out and the glacier melted all about 24 miles back and became this big bay there. So, we hunt at the northern part of the bay where there's a big glacier that's constantly moving all the time and that's where we hunt seals. And then along the coast is where we have fishing camps along the coast on the mouth of different rivers systems. So this is our traditional way of living is hunting the seals and fishing along the coast. 

Some of the fishermen fish right in the Pacific Ocean itself, and majority of fishermen fish just inside the rivers where the salmon enter the streams. And so a lot of the coast is eroding, so there's increased erosion of the shoreline along the coast. 

Elizabeth: Wow, that's amazing that even in, like, one of the coolest parts of Alaska, you're still seeing such drastic changes in the environment. 

Judy: Yeah, it is increasing, warming temperature, and the waters have reached these temperatures we've not seen before and the rivers gotten really hot. One of the other things is in southeast we usually get the cedar tree, and they're protected in the winter with snow. But with no snow anymore, the cedar trees have been dying off. So, they're looking at ways to plant the cedar for the North where there is no...that can have some protection of the cedar trees. That was another thing the Forest Service was experimenting on in Southeast. 

Elizabeth: Well, Judy, I can't tell you how helpful this has been. Thank you so much for talking to me today. I know you must be really busy, so I really appreciate it. 

Judy: Okay, so this is for ecology class. 

Elizabeth: Yes, it is. Yeah, no, you've been extremely helpful to me, so I really appreciate it. 

Judy: All right. So it's nice talking to you. Thank you. 

Elizabeth: Have a good MLK day. 

Judy: All right, bye. 

Elizabeth: Okay, bye.
