Interviewee: I've lived in Huntington Beach for 20 years. Huntington Beach is a city in California which is located at the edge of the Pacific Ocean. The beach itself has many activities that people engage in. There's surfing, and in fact, the city is called Surf City, as well as volleyball, roller skating, hiking, and so, just to name a few. Besides Huntington Beach, there's a place called Central Park that has a quaint little cafe called Kathy May's Lakeview Cafe. Central Park is the largest city that's owned in...Central Park is the largest city-owned park in Orange County covering about 350 acres of land. This peaceful setting is used for various activities such as picnicking, hiking, playing, and strolling along the paved paths. It's rated the top location for bird watching. It's the name of the largest...It has been home of the largest children's library west of the Mississippi. The date it was developed was in March 1974. So do you have another question for me?

Interviewer: What did this place look like before?

Interviewee: Well, many years ago, before I was here, it was just a swamp and there wasn't much of anything here from what I understand. But for the 20 years I've been here it's been pretty much the same. It has changed in the sense that it has several new things that they have built. And the park is actually divided into the two sections, the Central East and the Central West. And Central West has features like Lake Huntington, they have the Equestrian Park Center and they have a golf course. They have Kathy May's Lakeview Cafe, they have a dog park, and they have Shipley's Nature Center and various trails for walking. And on the east side, they have the Central Library Cultural Center and the Huntington Beach Sports Complex and the Park Bench Cafe and an amphitheater. So, today it's pretty much the same as it was then, but...Was there another question you had about that?

Interviewer: Well, how has it changed?

Interviewee: Oh, well, like I said, the change is pretty much not very existent, except for the fact that they now have a high Sports Complex Center where teams from all over the United States come and play softball. And I've even watched my granddaughter play softball there at that complex. I used to watch her and several other people from Oklahoma, where I'm from, come and it was an exciting kind of thing to watch. And then they also have a new Senior Center which was built not too long ago. It's right in the middle of the park, almost, and a lot of the seniors attend there with a lot of different activities that they have. And then what used to be Alice's Breakfast In the Park, has changed. They've changed hands, so it's no longer Alice's Park, it now is called Kathy May's Lakeview Cafe. They had to notice that when Kathy May took over in 2012, a TV show called, "The Dexter," produced an episode right in front of the cafe, and the people there in the cafe actually fed the cast that was there. So that was kind of an override for that particular place. What else was it?

Interviewer: Well, what are some of the things that you used to do there?

Interviewee: Oh, well, I used to take my grandchildren there when they were small and we went...but actually Alice's Park at that time that we fed the geese and we fed the ducks and we...Well, there's a playground there that they played on, there was a bunch of rabbits, and squirrels, and birds, and all those kind of things to observe. And then I took my brother there who was ill but he loved going there, because it's really kind of a peaceful place to be. Anything else?

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you do there now?

Interviewee: Oh, well, today, I enjoy eating there at Kathy May's, because Kathy May's has made a big change in the feeling itself. Because Alice's had just an enclosed area, and there wasn't any way to see outside. It was a neat enough restaurant, but today, Kathy May's has this big picture window that when you look outside, you can see all scenery and enjoy it just like you were on the outside. And then, so it's really more enjoyable to go there. And then also, you can go outside, they have benches and things out there that's right by the lake, and it's very enjoyable there, too. So they have a lot of different things there that I still attend. They have that Shipley's Nature Center which you can go and you can see different butterflies and birds and all kinds of flowers and fish. It's just a beautiful area to go to watch things in nature. And then there's the... Let's see, I do still go to the library because it has a lot of different cultural things to do, as well as my Friends of the Library books that people donate and you can buy them back. So you'll have to come to Huntington Beach and enjoy all these things that we've been talking about.
