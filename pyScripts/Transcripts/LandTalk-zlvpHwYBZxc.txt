Interviewer: What are the main differences you notice in the area?

Interviewee: The main differences I've noticed in Greenwich are that the homes in the town are much larger than they used to be, there's not as much land, there's more buildings and structures.

Interviewer: Okay. And then in terms of the reservoir and the lake itself, has the reservoir changed? Is it the same size as it used to be? Is it as reliable as a water source as it used to be? Has its purpose changed?

Interviewee: Well, growing up, the reservoir was always full. It always seemed like there was water all the way up to the top. In fact, in the wintertime, we would go ice skating out on the reservoir because it was, like, a lake. But now, over the years, I've noticed that the water has actually diminished, and it's very often low because there's so much demand on water in the town. With irrigation systems and more people living in the town, the population's grown, so there's a lot of people relying on that water source.

Interviewer: Is the reservoir the primary water source for the town of Greenwich?

Interviewee: Believe it or not the water source...the reservoir is the water source for the town, but we...even though we live on the reservoir because we live in backcountry, which is any property that's on a four acre lot or larger, we actually have our own water source, which is a well. So we have our own well water even though we live right on the reservoir.

Interviewer: And has the size of the reservoir changed itself? Have they made it larger or smaller?

Interviewee: No, I think it's always been the same size. What they do now though is they have different levels, like there's a level above the reservoir from us, and so very often what they'll do is they'll shut different water sources off because they're trying to manage the levels of each reservoir, which is why ours tends to diminish in the level of the water. Does that make sense?

Interviewer: Yes. And are there...do you know if there are any laws that prohibit you from building too close to the reservoir?

Interviewee: Yeah, there are laws where if you have a property that's on the reservoir, you're not allowed to build a certain amount of feet from the water source, and you're also not allowed to use any toxins on your lawn. So, most of the people that live around the reservoir are encouraged to use organic, you know, pesticides when they're treating their lawns.

Interviewer: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
