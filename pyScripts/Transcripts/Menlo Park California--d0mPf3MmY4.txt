Hayden: Hi, we are interviewing our guest about Menlo Park, California. How does Kepler's bookstore look now?

Interviewee: Wow, Kepler's bookstore is gigantic now, it's on El Camino. It's a really big bookstore, it's next to Borrone's cafe. 

Hayden: I go there.

Interviewee: There's tons of books that I love, but it also has a gigantic area for children.  

Hayden: Okay, can you described how Kepler's bookstore used to look?

Interviewee: It was really, really small, very tiny. I forget what the address was, but it was small, it might have been on El Camino, but I don't remember that either I just remember it being small.

Hayden: Okay, back to Oliver. 

Oliver: How has Menlo Park Caltrain changed?

Interviewee: Well, the trains are fancier and they're pretty colors now. And they go really, really fast. And they have a lot more people and some of the trains have double decks.

Oliver: I actually haven't been there.

Interviewee: You've never taken the train to the city?

Oliver: Never in my whole life.

Interviewee: You're gonna have to, it's fun.  

Oliver: Okay, how has Sand Hill Road changed?

Interviewee: A lot of traffic. Sand Hill used to be an easy way to get to Stanford University or hospital and used to be a really fast way to get to highway 280 and now there's a million cars and it's slow. But it's still pretty, there are more buildings, it's not as green.

Oliver: Wow. Thank you for sharing with us

interviewee: Thank you, you guys.

Hayden: Okay.
