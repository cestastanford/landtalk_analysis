Interviewer: Hi, we are interviewing guest about Menlo Park. Aria, how has Las Lomitas changed? 

Aria: Las Lomitas has changed in that there's so many more buildings and students and teachers than there used to be. It was a much smaller school when I first got here 24 years ago. There was no computer lab here, no library. In fact, the library was in a classroom, one of the classrooms over here like Miss McEwan's classroom. That's where the library was, and the computer room was in a room like that too. There was no second story building, everything was one story. And out here was a huge field with a grove of Redwood trees that the kids would eat lunch in and play by. 

Interviewer: Oh, and how has downtown Menlo Park changed? 

Aria: Downtown Menlo Park has gotten much busier. Of course, the traffic now is much busier than it used to be when I first came here. And there are now lots of apartment buildings and a lot of buildings that are new that weren't there when I came here 24 years ago, so it's gotten crowded and it's gotten more congested. Yeah. 

Interviewer: Okay Aria, how has Menlo Park Library changed? 

Aria: The Menlo Park Library? Oh the Menlo Park Library I think has moved into a brand new building. There it's gotten an expanded building anyway. 

Interviewer: Super big. 

Aria: Yeah, it's super big compared to what it used to be. Yeah. The parking lot is bigger too. 

Interviewer: Everything. 

Aria: Mm-hmm. 

Interviewer: How has Santo Road changed? 

Aria: Santo Road? Oh my goodness, Santo Road was kind of farmland. There were cows and farms along the side, kind of just cattle roaming the hills up there. There were no businesses, and of course there was no traffic. It was a two lane road, one direction one lane, the other direction the other lane. Now it's a six lane road and it gets congested. It's hard to even move on that road at 5:00 in the evening. Yeah.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing with us.
