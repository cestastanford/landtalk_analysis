Interviewer: Okay, can you state your name for the recording?

Adam: Adam Shaw.

Interviewer: And can you name the location that we will be discussing?

Adam: It's up state New York, Delmar, New York, latitude 42.609 longitude minus 73.88.

Interviewer: And how would you describe how the location looks right now?

Adam:  Right now it's early spring, there are some signs of growth of plants. Grass is starting to green up, buds are starting to come out on some of plants to flower. But mostly things are dead from all of the winter.    

Interviewer: And how has the location, how has it changed over time since you've lived there?

Adam: Well, it's been a lot more housing and a lot more developments built in. So some of the places that were more untouched or primordial or you know, kind of forests have given way to more neighborhoods and scrub and been cleared out.  So things are a lot more wild before and untouched so.

Interviewer: And what are some of the things that you used to do in the location, or rather what are some of the things that you do now? 

Adam: Some of the things we do now is we hike in the parks and we ride bikes on the roads. And you know, otherwise will we just commuted to work in Delmar community. 

Interviewer: Would you say that's different than things that you used to do?

Adam:  Slightly different. I mean, because there were more woods and open areas you can kind of ride bikes in the woods nearby, take hikes more nearby. And you know, you could live closer to the downtown area before and still feel like you were outside of the city area. And now that kind of sprawl from the city is extended so you can't do those activities anymore. And you need to live further away from the downtown city in order to get that same kind of feeling.
