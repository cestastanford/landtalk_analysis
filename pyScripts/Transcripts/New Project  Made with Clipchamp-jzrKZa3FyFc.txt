Brianna: My name is Brianna Brown. I am in the 12th grade, and I am 17 years old. I will be interviewing Evelyn [inaudible 00:00:08] about the Orpheum Theatre. Okay, Boo Ma, my first question for you is what was the Orpheum like when you were younger? 

Evelyn: The Orpheum was like a big, beautiful structural building on the corner of Main and Beale. I remember as a teenager going to the Malco Theater, then the old segregated where we had to do a lot of steps to go to see a movie, but it was worth it because it was a beautiful building. 

Brianna: Okay. My second question is how did it look compared to 20 years ago and now? 

Evelyn: They've done a lot of renovation to it. The insides have gone through a lot of remodeling of the building. Maybe new seats. But to me, it just the grandeur of the theater has never lost its flavor. 

Brianna: Okay. My next question, what was your best moment when it comes to the Orpheum?

Evelyn: I got a lot of great moments down through the years. After they closed their doors to the theater and went to the cultural side of the off-Broadway shows, I enjoyed so many Broadway shows. It was just great. The crowds was great. It was just something to carry with me all my days. 

Brianna: Okay. My next question is was the Orpheum segregated 20 years ago when you used to go? And if so, how was it segregated? Like, how were you all welcomed in? Where did you all have to sit, and things like that? 

Evelyn: Yeah, all the movie theaters here in Memphis were segregated, other than our neighborhood theaters. But downtown theaters, all those were segregated. We had to go up steps and steps and just a lot of steps, stairs, to get to our seating, the blacks, to see a movie. But all the theaters on Main Street during the hustle and bustle of Main Street, which was the culture of our downtown Memphis, it was worth going up the steps because we really didn't have a choice. But once we got to our seating we enjoyed the moment. 

Brianna: Even though were you treated differently because of the color of your skin, that didn't change your mind about going to the Orpheum? You still wanted to go? 

Evelyn: I still wanted to go in one sense. If you wanted to go to Main Street we didn't have a choice because all the theaters on Main Street were segregated back in the 50's and 60's. So we didn't have a choice. But it didn't change my mind because that just was a way of life for us, knowing that one day it would be better. 

Brianna: Okay. Were the prices different for colored and whites when you were going? 

Evelyn: Not that I can remember about the price. I don't know if it was cheaper because we had to go up so far to our seats. I don't know, don't remember that. 

Brianna: What was one of the best movies you saw when you went to Orpheum?

Evelyn: I can't remember a movie. When it was the Malco Theatre...then it came back to the Orpheum, renamed Orpheum when it came to the cultural sense in our community. I saw so many Broadway shows, off-Broadway shows. "Driving Miss Daisy," "The Wizard of Oz," "Dreamgirls," and so many, many more plays. Those were more memorable. I can't remember a name of a movie that I saw. That was so far back. 

Brianna: How often did you go to the Orpheum?

Evelyn: Whenever a Broadway show came to Memphis and I went to see one, it had my imagination going knowing that it would be once in a lifetime to experience something like that. I would take my family, especially my children, to envision the cultural side of life. So the plays were all spectacular, something that I saw here right in the inner city on Main Street.

Brianna: Okay. Another question. I'm trying to think of a good way to word it. How did the Orpheum go from a movie theater to the Orpheum? Did they tear it down, or did something tragic happen for it to be changed? 

Evelyn: Well back in the 20's, the history of the...I went back and look at some of the history of the Orpheum. It was built to replace the first Orpheum, and that's 19...we're talking about 1928. And then it burned down, and then it was rebuilt and so...I don't know, just me being a teenager and the age I am, I didn't really start going to the Malco Theatre, then it changed back to the Orpheum, and that's when I just went and enjoyed all the plays. My kids liked it, and then I had co-workers, so I would get tickets for them. We just went as groups, and just really enjoyed ourselves. It was just once in a lifetime for young people growing up in Memphis, and to be introduced to the cultural side, and to introduce your family, your children especially. And to witness some of the best musical plays and dramatic plays that we would have to travel to some of the larger cities like New York or other big cities, Los Angeles maybe, to see something like that, we had this right here in our backyard. 

Brianna: Do you think the Orpheum would be better if it stayed MalcoTheatre or do you think it's just the same as the Orpheum? 

Evelyn: No, it was good when it changed from a theater because we have a lot of a theaters here in Memphis now, but it's not a lot of movie-goers now with the modern...all the new technology that they have here. So to have the Orpheum to stand as a cultural building, to go into different events they had...

Brianna: Do you think the Orpheum's changes were good changes or do you think it should have stayed the same? 

Evelyn: I believe the changes were great for the betterment of our community. Our community, to bridge the gap between our races, the Orpheum brought that to the forefront. We had all these beautiful Broadway shows, and I was so fortunate to go see so many of them. "The Wizard of Oz," "Driving Miss Daisy," oh, "Dreamgirls," and so many, many more. It bridged the gap between the races because whenever there's an event there now, during halftime, either during our seating, who we're sitting next to, or behind, or in front of us, we tend to have a conversation during intermission. When you go to the concession for refreshments, and conversation just automatically starts up and it is a beautiful thing for our different races. The cultural aspect of it is remarkable. Yeah, I think it was really for the best [inaudible 00:10:03].

Brianna: So do you think the Orpheum has changed for the better? What is the last play that you've seen in the Orpheum and how much did you enjoy it? 

Evelyn: The last play I saw, actually was last year, I went to see "The Color Purple." I had seen it before, but I was really enthused about going, excited about going to see it again. The Orpheum was packed. Oh, it was...the play was beautiful, the people were beautiful, great conversation with people sitting next to you. During halftime great conversations started up. Everything was just beautiful. A beautiful setting that you only maybe see or witness if you go to one of our largest cities, Boston or New York City or Los Angeles. This we got here in our backyard, Memphis, Tennessee on the corner of Main and Beale.

Brianna: Is there anything that you would like to say to anybody visiting that can influence them to go visit the Orpheum?

Evelyn: They have events all the time, all through the year. And I could look up and see maybe an event that's coming. I can tell them about it, and all I can do is tell them and they'll say, "Okay," and "We gonna get tickets. And we are off to a great entertainment time." 

Brianna: Okay, thank you.
