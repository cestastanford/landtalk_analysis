Interviewer: All right, so this is my dad, Edward Go. And I'm going to be interviewing him today. So what area are you going to be talking about today, Dad? 

Edward: I'm going to talk about my old house situated in Nimit Drive, Bloomington, the subdivision in Golden Estate. I moved there in the year 1993. 

Interviewer: Okay, so what do you first remember?

Edward: I liked the house because it is very sunny and bright. The floorplan is simple. It is in a cul de sac, no much through traffic. But it's a little bit far from the university campus where I work. 

Interviewer: Okay, what was your favorite part about living there?

Edward: Peace and quiet, and also the house is very nice, from outside as well as inside. 

Interviewer: What was the landscape like back then versus right now?

Edward: The house was one year old when I moved there. The last owner had just started planting a row of pine trees between the two properties. Other than that, it's very sparse. And after we moved there we started to plant a rose garden in front and the shrub all over the place. 

Interviewer: So have any of the types of animals you see there changed over the years?

Edward:  Yes, there used to be a lot of hare and squirrels on the back, but as the property around it developed, there was fewer and fewer of those creatures over the years.

Interviewer: Okay, how has the weather changed over the last 20 years?

Edward: The weather, well, the weather changed a lot in the last 20 years. We used to have a lot of snow and some...one time we had about 14 or 15 inches fo snow. Nowadays, we barely get two or three inches of accumulations at this time in the winter. So the weather, the amount of snow changed. I'm sure the amount of rain we got have changed. And summer has gotten hotter than we're used to. And winter, it didn't get colder, but a lot less snow. 

Interviewer: Great. Can you tell me a little bit more about the snow? Were there any big storms that you remember?

Edward: Yes, yes. There's one big storm that's about 16 - 18 inches of accumulation. You were about two then. The snow accumulation was taller than you were. And we were trying to dig our way...clear our driveway but the snow was 18 inches, so we could only get a short distance before we give it up. And then we hire a big grader to grade the driveway to clear the snow off.

Interviewer: All right, and what kinds of hobbies have you picked up here living in Bloomington?

Edward: Bloomington? Well, gardening is one thing that I pick up because over at that house we don't have problem with the deer, so we can grow a lot of cauliflowers, vegetables, and stuff like that. Nowadays, in our new house, we have problems with the deer, and they eat everything that I put out, so I no longer doing that. 

Interviewer: All right, and lastly, what do you miss most about living here or there 20 years ago?

Edward: Well, it's a two-story house. As I get older I don't feel like climbing stairs as much as when I was younger. So I don't really miss a lot about the house. We're now living in a single-story house and I don't have to climb stairs. So I like this house better than the old house. 

Interviewer: All right, thank you.
