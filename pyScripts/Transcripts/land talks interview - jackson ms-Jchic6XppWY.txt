Julie: Hi, I'm Julie Freels. I am taking Deborah Gordon's ecology for everyone class and I'm interviewing my mom about Jackson, Mississippi. You can introduce yourself, mom.

Elizabeth: Hello, my name is Elizabeth Freels, I'm Julie's mother. And I've lived in Jackson for 20 something years.

Julie: So what did Jackson look like 20 years ago?

Elizabeth: It was a small rural town even though it is capital of the state, but it was small rural town.

Julie: So to give some context to that, where are you from?

Elizabeth: I'm from Moscow. Moscow as in Russian Federation. It is a city with a population of between 15 to 20 million. So the general vibe you would get is the same as if you have moved from New York, different energy, more people, more things to do, more infrastructure, more culture, more people, like I already said.

Julie: So to describe Jackson as a rural 20 years ago.

Elizabeth: Yes. It was a smaller town with very basic infrastructure. I would put it this way, very basic store chains and fast food chains, very basic industries. It is called hospitality state, I guess maybe because of the coast. But I didn't live at the Gulf Coast meaning I lived in their capital area. And there was not a whole lot of industry or a whole lot of anything for that matter. But there were pluses and minuses to it. Of course, minuses is that for younger people, there was simply not enough to do in a modern sense of the word, but a lot of people appreciated this lifestyle. It was very close to nature: hunting, fishing, picnicking.

Julie: So even though there were fewer cultural activities in Jackson, were there any...like anything that you enjoyed doing?

Elizabeth: Unless there was somebody on tour and going through Jackson, otherwise, local culture was not much of an interest. They have very basic Arts Museum, like I said, very basic. They have a Mississippi Symphony Orchestra, that was not bad.

Julie: Was that around 20 years ago?

Elizabeth: Yes, they go around 20 years ago as well.

Julie: So what about nature in Jackson, what was it like?

Elizabeth: Excuse me.

Julie: What about nature in Jackson?

Elizabeth: Nature? Now nature wasn't as rather vibrant and nice. Although I would say the general tendency is there's a lot of areas that are suburbia now and well developed, I remember when it was just the fields and the cow pastures and the woods. And then they started developing it very quickly, as we were observing it driving by. As a result of it, for instance, the population of deer increased drastically because deer didn't have any natural predator or don't have any natural predator but their habitat was shrinking rapidly. They would cut down the trees and so I personally lost two of my vehicles to a deer as I ran into a deer or a deer ran into me, rather.

Julie: So where did you usually see deer? Like, in...

Elizabeth: Just driving on the roads, Interstate.

Julie: In the Interstate?

Elizabeth: Interstate, highways, small roads.

Julie: So what about...were there any other wildlife that you noticed?

Elizabeth: We saw a lot of wildlife more than I'm used to being from a bigger city. We have seen... What is the big cat, Julie? A pat on my back.

Julie: The big cat? A panther, a cougar?

Elizabeth: Cougar, there you go. We have seen a couple of cougars. We have seen plenty of rabbits and turkeys.

Julie: I remember snakes in front of our house all the time.

Elizabeth: Snakes, alligators. We had a turkey that fell on our car and broke our windshield. Yes. And we had feather sticking out of the windshield. Me and my mom, we were driving in the car in Brookhaven and a turkey just fell on our heads from nowhere really.

Julie: I remember when grandma came to visit, she did a lot of gardening in our yard.

Elizabeth: Yes. So...

Julie: Can you tell what our house was like?

Elizabeth: We lived in a...it's a mobile home, the first one that we lived in when you were little, you probably didn't remember it. And then we just lived in a basic 15-feet, one-story brick home that was across the road from the dairy farm. And it was not far from...so it was very rural living. For somebody who is used to it and content with rural living, it was probably perfect. I was raised differently and it was a major shift for me. It was actually pretty painful. I was used to much more civilized way of living.

But I noticed that as far as the flora life in Mississippi, is it is abundant. They have a very, very developed lumber industry. And over the years, I've noticed them cutting a lot of lumber down. So you would see a whole lot more of bald spots where they used to have forest. Supposedly, it was usually done, the biggest company who was facilitating that was Georgia Pacific, as far as I know. So all those little small lumber companies were selling it to Georgia Pacific. And they were supposed to restore the population of the trees.

I personally didn't necessarily see it happening. Maybe there's some waiting period, maybe you have to wait for a few years before you can replant the trees, I don't know that. And also, they were huge on producing gravel and sand. They were shipping it all across the country. And I saw a huge gravel pits, like, you could hide a house in a gravel pit. So that was somewhat concerning to me because I felt like they were just exploiting their rural... Help me here.

Julie: Their resources.

Elizabeth: Resources, yes.

Julie: So do you think like...what were some changes that you saw that you think were in response? Or did you see any changes in response to those like...like you mentioned that the deer population, like they ran out of...or they were taking their habitat pretty much, did you notice any other changes because of human interactions?

Elizabeth: Well...

Julie: Or any changes at all over time?

Elizabeth: So they started actively and aggressively building, the new chains appeared, so for people it was more to do and it was more fun. I guess there were more things where you could go shopping or spend time or restaurants, they would just cut out the territories there and build shopping malls, little strip malls, gas stations, big chains like Home Depot's and so on.

So Bass Pro Shops, Mississippi used to have none of those things when I first moved here. Like I said, it was very basic local mom and pop shops. So in 20 years, they caught up, but it's, you know, it's there are pluses and minuses to it. I don't think Mississippi arrived to a point where industry was just like a ruining nature. I think right now they are at the perfect balance. For reasons that have nothing to do with the socioeconomic reasons, I don't think they're going to get much of a growth.

Julie: Interesting. So you don't think that it's going to become more urbanized, I guess? Industrialized?

Elizabeth: No, I don't think so. Because organization it's a complex part of the different factors including, for instance, political climate in the area and legislative climate in the area. And political and legislative climate in Mississippi is not user friendly, let me put it this way. So I actually currently and recently read an article about the huge...what is a good word for it? So brains are leaving the state. Current college graduates who went to school out of state do not come back. A lot of kids who graduate they move out. A lot of people who used to live there move out, including like our family, you know, we moved away. And it has to do a lot with the fact that a lot of businesses do not want to come to Mississippi.

Julie: Yeah. So...

Elizabeth: So I think right now they're at the saturation point. Everybody who wanted to be there is there. And unless something changes any other areas, I don't think the economy is gonna start declining, but it's good. [inaudible 00:10:52] it's good for the nature.

Julie: Yeah, it's probably a good thing that there are some places that are not...

Elizabeth: Unfortunately, the big changes...you know, you cannot just live in Mississippi and preserve it and hope that, in this particular area, nothing is going to change. You know, the change is like climatic changes, they are affecting the whole regions. For instance, I'm talking to my friends in Mississippi and they're saying that they have temperatures lower than we have here at the Pacific Northwest in the winter, which is absurd.

Julie: Yeah.

Elizabeth: Well, they have snow.

Julie: It's snowed a lot this year, didn't it?

Elizabeth: It snowed a lot, which is completely...

Julie: I don't remember that much snow in my childhood.

Elizabeth: Yeah, because it never snowed. In the first 20 years that I've lived there, I've never felt snow. And then in the last five years, well...let me put it this way, 15 and 5. In the last five years when we were living in Mississippi, we saw snow almost every year.

Julie: Yeah. So 20 years ago or like I guess over the years, what did you like to do in Mississippi? I'm sure that there's something.

Elizabeth: There was nothing compliant about Mississippi, that the things that I like doing, I couldn't do. I enjoy art life, museums, theater, just like cultural life, concerts, I like walking down the streets to window shop, and Mississippi has almost no pedestrian.

Julie: It's not pedestrian friendly. I remember, we didn't get sidewalks until like two years ago.

Elizabeth: This is when we moved to Madison. And Madison was just a little bubble.

Julie: Yeah. They didn't even have sidewalks in Madison. 

Elizabeth: Not even there, they weren't either. Besides, the weather is not very, but even if you had sidewalks, you couldn't really walk a whole lot in the summertime because of their temperatures and the humidity level, unless you just carried around an oxygen tank. There was no air.

Julie: Yeah.

Elizabeth: So what I like to do, I'm a rather sociable person and I created a circle of friends and our biggest entertainment was just visit each other and to entertain each other.

Julie: Maybe that's why it's called the hospitality state because there's nothing to do but entertain each other.

Elizabeth: You know, I have my reservations about it because I have been to the states that are not called hospitality states and they're much more hospitable.

Julie: So what are some things that you did that maybe you didn't like doing or like any activities?

Elizabeth: I did not… What I didn't like doing? Oh, gosh, where do I start? I don't want to give you like a loaded question. It will not have to do rather with an environment. I did not like the fact that my husband liked hunting and he would skin deer in the backyard. Maybe I was very...it's not snobbish is not the word for you.

Julie: I think that that's a reasonable thing to dislike. I think hunting is very polarizing

Elizabeth: Yeah, there's enough cows and other farm animals being killed for our...although, but on the other hand, see, you have to control deer population. And, you know, they used to have cougars who would hunt deer and now there were none, for whatever reason cougars went away, so somebody had to control the population. The same thing was happening to alligators.

I did not like the fact that we could not be more outdoorsy because of the extreme temperatures in the summertime. I did not like that they did not have snow, this type of climate. I would never move to Florida in my life because I think long term, human beings have to experience four seasons. This is, you know, when you live in a perpetual summer, it gives you like neurosis overhears. I did not like the fact that we had to drive everywhere, and we couldn't walk. So, yeah.

Julie: So have any of the things that you did in Mississippi like change? Like, has it got a little bit more industrialized weather?

Elizabeth: Yeah. I have to give it to Mississippians. They were...especially, I am not…don't remember the names, there was one particular governor who was not very favorable by people, however, he improved their economy. 

Julie: Was it Phil Bryant?

Elizabeth: I would say, probably. Who was before Phil Bryant? Maybe he was Phil Bryant, yes.

Julie: I remember meeting him at a work function.

Elizabeth: Yes. He came to your school and begged everyone to...because it was 30-Plus ACT club. And he came and made a speech about the fact that no 30-Plus ACT kids have ever come back to Mississippi after they graduate from their fancy universities and I found it very ironic. So this is where we met him.

Julie: We meet someone at Nucor Steel at a...

Elizabeth: Yeah. At Nucor Steel, we met the governor who was before Phil... Oh, was it Phil Bryant as well?

Julie: I think so.

Elizabeth: Possibly, yes. Yeah, he was...Nucor was a big supporter.

Julie: Do they not have term limits on governors? That's weird.

Elizabeth: I think it's four years as everywhere else.

Julie: I guess time passed very slowly.

Elizabeth: Right. Yeah, especially when you're younger, time passes slowly. This is the first sign of aging when years start just rushing by, but you're not quite there yet.

Julie: Sorry, so do you go back to that.

Elizabeth: So there were some positive changes. Like I said, they started catching up with the rest of the country. They finally put in Whole Foods and measured market. So you start getting some with better selection of products. They got better shopping, put some of their outlet malls. So, you know, I think the location of the Mississippi itself is nice because you go left and pretty fast you're in the West, you go right and you're to the East. It's straight shoot to Chicago area. So location of the state is perfect to go to other places.

Julie: Yeah. That's good. It got some positives.

Elizabeth: Yeah.

Julie: Okay. Did you want to add anything? Like any comments? Anything we didn't talk about that you want to say?

Elizabeth: So since you're interviewing me my understanding is it has to do with ecological issues, environmental issues, I would say that, I guess the big minus was also that this is a tornado area?

Julie: Yeah.

Elizabeth: We lived through Katrina and through the other. And I have…three other hurricanes, with Katrina, I guess, was the most massive one that I remember. And it gave us a slight, a little sliver of post-apocalyptic world and how it might be. It was very...like I said, it was very slight, it was very light, it was for a very brief little period of time, but it made me realize how some of the things that we take for granted now, if they go away, like...

Julie: Things like electricity.

Elizabeth: …cars couldn't pump gas. There was no gas and cars were lined up along the roads for miles and miles with no gas. And you couldn't pump gas because there was no electricity and pumps are electric, and so are the ATM machines. You could not use plastic. So I heard cases where people sold $20 cash deals for $100 checks for people to cash at a later day. Yeah. So cash money has become a currency in itself. And things like this, this is something that you would never think about otherwise, unless something like this happens.

Julie: So what was Katrina like where we lived? Because I know that we got...

Elizabeth: Well, Katrina was...it was horrible, horrible. It was like a nuclear bomb went off without radiation. Because we had a family from Slidell down who stayed with us, remember?

Julie: Yeah.

Elizabeth: For short period of time. And then we made a trip. And I think it was six months after Katrina, so it wasn't even right away. It was much, much later and it was very depressing, the view. There were miles and miles, tens of miles of drowned vehicles, debris, broken trees...
