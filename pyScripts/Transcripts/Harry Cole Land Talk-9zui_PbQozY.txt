James: My name is James Cole and the place we're describing is Northwest Arkansas. Town I live in, is Rogers, Arkansas, which is next door to Bentonville, Arkansas. We've lived here since about 1998. Well, say physically, it's pretty similar, although the first thing I would say is when we moved here, actually, we were living in the same home that we lived in for most the entire time. And probably the interesting thing is that I think infrastructure wise, there's been quite a bit of development. There's an interstate freeway that was partially constructed when we first moved here that, is now, you know, virtually all the way constructed where, you know, makes it very easy to travel either south to Little Rock or North to Kansas City.

And that was not kind of the case when we first moved here, they'd just opened. And so it was kind of a big development to really open up the area to kind of easily travel, either way, north or south. I tell you the other thing that is interesting is that Fayetteville was kind of at the center of Northwest Arkansas and I think that's probably changed more now. The area where we lived, Rogers, is more developed, I'd say culturally too. It was more the feeling of a college town. Of course, you know, the area we're in, Rogers, is more known for being the headquarters for Walmart.

And so there's been a lot of cultural changes. I think they were kind of brought on more by Walmart than by the university. The community we moved into, you know, back in 1998 it was still kind of had the feeling of, was proud of being kind of a small southern town. But over time, Walmarts kind of focus a change from keeping up. I think they had been more focused on keeping a small southern town. And so at the time I first started, the vendors who service Walmart, you know, the Proctor and Gamble, you know, Kimberly Clark and other big vendors to retailers would just come in basically and visit. 

But at a certain point in time, I'd say about probably you know, about 2008 or so, maybe  I'm wrong on the date, but roughly around then. They kind of changed the direction to the vendors and they wanted them to have a presence here. So that caused a lot of development here just to you know, accommodate more people. And then on top of it too, I think the people that came in were more veteran workers for those companies. And so they were hiring calm and I think it kind of changed now the economic structure in the town.

Harry: That's interesting. So I assume... Okay.

James: But I'd say also too that,  you know, had some social changes too because, you know, I think when it became more affluent but also came different people from outside the area. Kind of the change. One of the other things that can happen, it happened shortly before we moved here but you think about it being kind of a company town, the founder of the company, Sam Walton, he had basically been recently deceased by the time we moved here. And so you get a little bit further away from his passing that you've got kind of his influence being, you know, here's the founder of the company who drove around in a pickup truck and wasn't very showy as far as, you know, his economic well-being, even though I think everybody knew. You know, still was driving to work in a pickup truck. 

Till now we're probably, we're a little bit further away from that and you know, maybe people who were in the town or more apt to be driving maybe a Mercedes or BMW or a Land Rover or something like that. But you probably didn't see it back in 1998. Hey, now a few Teslas around town. Personally, I mean, you yourself were just an infant when we first moved here. So you pretty much had grown up here in Northwest Arkansas, you know, probably. And your sister, she was young. She was just, you know, in first grade. 

And so you've grown up in the schools and I think having a positive thing has been the schools have gotten better around here continuously and which is a good thing. And I think part of the other thing that, you know, if it was true when we moved here but also, you know, still true is, you know, is probably in comparison to a lot of Arkansas is a more diverse community. So you've got, you know, a lot of folks are Hispanic or you know, or now you know, that they're working, you know, coming from the international business side, you see a lot of folks from India or you know, Chinese, you know, here in town. 

So, you know, it's always been a little bit unique to the area just for having that diversity, I think. And it just makes it kind of interestin, you know, in comparison to rest of Arkansas. But I would say the other part of the area too, that, you know, has changed, has been from the recreation standpoint is, you know, there was a movie theater, you know, that was close by. Now there's three in town. If you, like I said about the highways, you know, that are here, if I wanted to go see a baseball game in Kansas City, I can go do it now. It's a lot easier. 

You know, libraries were always good, even when we moved here but I think they've gotten better. There's an art museum there wasn't here, which is, you know, certainly made a big difference. The Nice Art Museum made a big difference in the community. The biggest thing probably is the airport was when we first got here, you had to drive down to Fayetteville and it was kind of unreliable because you had the pilot fee and small planes that used the field, you know, flights didn't go out on time or, you know, frequently. 

And now you've got an airport that's, you know, you get to go out on a direct flight to San Francisco, which I don't think, well maybe if we can go to all centers there's a flight that's direct into San Francisco. But even at that, probably I'd have to go drive to Kansas City to get you on a direct flight. And so we've got a direct flight to San Francisco, and we've got a direct flight to Los Angeles, direct flight to Laguardia, a direct flight to DC. So, you know, it's made the opportunity to travel a lot easier. And, you know, given us other choices what to do.

I'd say, you know, it's still a nice area and you know,  there's still the opportunity. There's a lot of, you know, Arkansas's a natural state. There's still a lot of, you know, beautiful areas. You know, maybe it's a little bit tougher to see them on my way to work than they used to be but in the morning. But you know, it's still available and nearby and which is nice.
