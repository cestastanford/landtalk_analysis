Sabrina Howard: My name is Sabrina Howard, and the person who I will be interviewing is Yvonne Howard. And the place that we're going to be talking about mostly is North Brentwood, Maryland. And if I can just ask you some questions, will that be okay?

Yvonne Howard: Yes.

Sabrina Howard: Okay. How long... Where are you originally from?

Yvonne Howard: I am originally from North Carolina, Murfreesboro, a small city. Yeah, Murfreesboro, North Carolina.

Sabrina Howard: Okay, and how did you know... you moved to Maryland what year?

Yvonne Howard: I moved to Maryland in 1988.

Sabrina Howard: So around 30 something years, right?

Yvonne Howard: Exactly.

Sabrina Howard: Okay, that's not bad at all. So you moved to North Brentwood, Maryland?

Yvonne Howard: Correct.

Sabrina Howard: Okay.

Yvonne Howard: But first, before I moved to North Brentwood, Maryland, I was living in DC with my sister. And then two years later I moved to Maryland. That was prior to me, leaving the military.

Sabrina Howard: Okay. Since you've been in North Brentwood for so long. Have you noticed [inaudible 00:01:26]... have you noticed anything different, with the landscaping?

Yvonne Howard: Well, yes. Right on the street that we were living in they had a little old rundown barbershop and jukebox. And there they are uplifting that building and they're going to bring it back to life with the renovation. And there is still going to be a barbershop and a little small jukebox.

Sabrina Howard: I'm actually talking about, like, the things that are, like, came around, like, I know there's a jukebox and it's like cute and small. But I'm talking more so like on big things like what's changed, like, was there a new building, new houses?

Yvonne Howard: Yes. houses in that neighbourhood, they were somewhat like very old. And they tore most of them down. The house we were living in, it was like an apartment before we moved. And they tore that building down and they built three new houses. And when they built three new houses I bought one of them. And then the houses down the street, they was like, one caught on fire, and they rebuilt that beautiful five-bedroom, and it's nice. And the house across the street, they tore that down and rebuild a brick house. They just got rid of old buildings. And there was nothing at the end of the street. So they built up three-storey house there as well. So the housing areas there has been a lot of new houses built in this area. And the dam that the water flows, they rebuild the dam and that's bigger and safer so that we don't have to worry about floods in the area.

Sabrina Howard: So since, like, since they fixed the dam and stuff, like, has there ever been a flood before they fixed the dam?

Yvonne Howard: Well, actually not since I've been there. Because the dam was always there when I moved. But prior to that the area used to flood a lot.

Sabrina Howard: Okay so you came there, you know, when all the flooding was done with?

Yvonne Howard: Correct.

Sabrina Howard: But that's really not bad. Thank you, Ms Howard, for this interview.

Yvonne Howard: Oh, thank you.
