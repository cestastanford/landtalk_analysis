Interviewer: Oh, call's being recorded. All right, let's do this. Still there?

Interviewee: Yes, I'm here.

Interviewer: Okay. So the purpose of this call is basically, I just wanna hear about, you know, one place that you have stayed in for approximately 20 or so years, and how the landscape in that place changed over time, to sort of understand, like, how the ecology of the region changes, and then also, like, what being in a place for a couple of decades looks like from an environmental perspective. And with your case, you said you were born back in the '30s, right?

Interviewee: 1931.

Interviewer: Yeah, 1931, so how that place really developed while you were growing up there, industrially and environmentally. So let's get started. 

Interviewee: Okay. So I'm telling you that I'm, at this point 87 1/2 years old. The first 18 years of my life were spent in a small town. There were about 8,000 people living there. It was in the northeast area of Pennsylvania. Now, that was a hard coal area in the Appalachia, and mining was the chief industry through there, so that there were many dark banks of coal silt, S-I-L-T, left over from the mines. Let me just say that my small town, through some geologic fluke, had none of the coal under it that was found in other areas, so my particular town sat up about 1,400 above sea level, was beautiful, and the natural environment was hilly, you might even call it mountainous, with a few lakes, streams, and of course, very undeveloped. My early memories were of unpaved roads, but by the time I was in high school they were paved. Also will tell you that my initial home, we had an outhouse, and I wouldn't tell today that...course, I lived there...

Interviewer: Was...oh, so despite the coal mines, you said it was still a very naturally beautiful area when you were living there?

Interviewee: Well, what I explained is that my particular town, though it was in the midst of a mining area, through some geologic fluke, there was no coal directly under my town, so it was unscathed by black dust, and a small area, I guess a couple hundred acres, was beautiful and green. Strange, but that's the way it worked out. 

Interviewer: Yeah, that's interesting. 

Interviewee: Yeah. Nevertheless, I went to high school by bus, and that was all a very sort of blackish atmosphere. In fact, one small settlement there, as we traveled by bus, the pavements were uneven, probably because of the mines underneath it. 

Interviewer: So as you...oh, go ahead. 

Interviewee: Go ahead. 

Interviewer: Oh, okay. So as you were growing up, certainly the mining increased, right?

Interviewee: Well, the coal mining was prominent until after the Second War ended in '45, and as the demand for all that coal, although some existed, the demand fell gradually, and the area fell into a economically depressed area, and never recovered its economic prominence. And the area is still depressed, with some small industrial areas. I haven't kept up with that aspect of it, though. But it's still there. 

Interviewer: And this is…it's in the… This is Frackville, right? 

Interviewee: This is Frackville.

Interviewer: Up in Northern Pennsylvania?

Interviewee: Yes. Northeastern. 

Interviewer: Northeastern. 

Interviewee: Now, there were apparently, although there is one or two federal prisons up that way, and that has provided a lot of employment. And of course there are the usual malls, and they all have shopping malls, so that also employs a number of people. 

Interviewer: That's interesting. Yeah, it's amazing that a town like that would have just gotten totally shut down after 1945. 

Interviewee: Well, I wouldn't say totally, but the whole area. My town had about 8,000 people, but there were other, of course. There was Pottsville. There was an author called John O'Hara, he lived in Pottsville. That was something about nine miles east, I believe, of Frackville, so there were other towns. And Redding, Pennsylvania had some small industries, so I've been...

Interviewer: That's interesting.

Interviewee: ...referring to my area when I speak of the small town. 

Interviewer: Got it. What...oh. 

Interviewee: Environmentally, my town was beautiful, and we spent a lot of time wandering in the woods picking huckleberries. You would sell your huckleberries for about 10 cents a quart. When they got short of supply, it would go to 18 cents a quart, and that was real money.

Interviewer: So as you were growing up, were there any, like, major environmental changes or anything like that, or did it pretty much stay the same, even through the economic downturns and such?

Interviewee: I'm not quite sure what you have just asked me. Could you repeat that?

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. I was just curious, were there any changes in the environment itself, like the ecology, or the forestry, or anything like that?

Interviewee: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. There was a river called the Schuylkill River, and it was so black with coal it just killed anything alive in it. Sometime later, I guess perhaps even after I left, or I wasn't attuned to it to notice, the government did clean it up from all the coal pollution, so that was one big thing. There is a coal fire in an area, not...well, it may be within 40 miles of my home, not exact mileage, but not far, that has a fire burning in a coal vein, and it still burns. It's been burning for decades. 

Interviewer: Wow. 

Interviewee: And in fact, the few people who lived there, I don't know, 10, 20 homes, had to move because of the danger, you know, right underneath their feet.

Interviewer: What did that fire do to the environment? Like, did it just make it toxic? Did it make the air bad quality, or was it just you had the risk of flammability?

Interviewee: I never heard that it's affected the air quality, just that it's burning underneath, and posed a danger to the few homes that were on top of it. If you look up Centralia, Pennsylvania, they'll tell you a lot more about it. Because I didn't know enough, you know, as a kid you're involved in your own growing up, but it's there, and that information is online. 

Interviewer: That's interesting. Yeah, that's...so it's still burning today? That's pretty crazy.

Interviewee: I would imagine that it probably is.

Interviewer: Are you going to...oh, go ahead. 

Interviewee: These coal veins run really deep and, you know, once you start that burning, I don't quite understand myself, but it just continues to burn along that coal seam. Okay. 

Interviewer: Wow, that's crazy. 

Interviewee: Uh-huh. 

Interviewer: Let's see, what else? So generally, the changes over time were the government sort of, with this river, right? And they cleaned up the river, and then that's the...

Interviewee: The Schuylkill River, S-C-H...

Interviewer: Does that run through your town?

Interviewee: It starts a couple miles away from my town as a small stream, and then it developed into a bigger river, running down, I'm pretty sure, through Philadelphia, into Philadelphia, yeah. 

Interviewer: Have you gone back since you left there when you were in your late teens, early 20s?

Interviewee: Well, of course, while my parents were alive we would go back to visit them. Here's an interesting aside. When I was growing up, and for many years before that, there were several clothing factories, shirt factory, bathrobe factory, and many, many women in the town worked there. And, you know, when the mines were on strike, which was frequently...

Interviewer: Yeah, of course.

Interviewee: The women brought in money. Now, I'm sorry I can't date it exactly, but those factories were shuttered, and they were moved down South for cheaper labor. However, within a number of years, they left the South of the United States and moved to foreign areas. And I wish I could tell you exactly, but eventually ending up in Bangladesh, China, etc.

Interviewer: Yeah, no, like, yeah, the U.S. outsourcing of labor has been really a trend over the past few decades, which is pretty interesting to see. It sounds like, honestly, more than environmentally, a lot of this town's changes were economic. 

Interviewee: Exactly. Exactly. Environmentally, the coal business practically has left, you know, like I told you. Somehow these towns hang on. I really don't understand how, but the people love the area, and the cost of living is much lower up that way. I went to a high school, Shenandoah, you can check out, Shenandoah, S-H-E-N-A-N-D-O-A-H, by bus, that was seven miles away, and that's a depressed area. However, people somehow, and don't ask me how, they eke out a living, and that's how it goes. And many people who grew up there, a number of them return there in retirement, because living is cheaper. Okay. 

Interviewer: Yeah, that's pretty interesting. 

Interviewee: Now, let me just add a little human interest. It was a great place to grow up for me, in my town. It was, as I said, it was green and beautiful. We would skate on the lakes. It was so cold so many times the lakes would freeze. For boys, it was a great growing up. Tons of fishing, they would hunt, and of course, when they'd get older, they had beer bottles in the hills. For women it was, girls, it was a little bit less of an adventure, but let's just leave it at that. 

Interviewer: All right, well, yeah, it was a different time. 

Interviewee: Yes, it was a different time, and it's...my mother grew up riding a horse and buggy. She was born in 1902 and died in '83. By the time she had died, of course, she had ridden in an airplane to visit some of her kids across the country. So from horse and buggy to air travel, that's quite a gap.

Interviewer: Yeah, that is crazy. Really the world's really developed, really, through history. 

Interviewee: Sure, and you're going to have a more rapid...because I understand the computer doubles every two years. 

Interviewer: Yeah, that's Moore's law. I'm running into the edge of that. 

Interviewee: You're in for a wild ride...

Interviewer: Yes, it's certainly exciting, if nothing else. 

Interviewee: Now, is there anything else I can cover for you?

Interviewer: So, you really touched on what growing up was like, what the environment was kinda like there, how the environment really changed over time. Did you notice any economic impact on the environment? Like, did those two go hand in hand ever, like as the economics of the society changed, the environment changed, or, like post-World War II?

Interviewee: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 

Interviewer: Okay, yeah?

Interviewee: Sure, because as the coal jobs left, what were the young people to do? Well, here's an interesting thing. My father was great at math, and he was a self-taught coal mining engineer. Instead of going to college himself, he went only to eighth grade, but he sent his only sister to what was called "Normal School," that was college, and she taught math until she was 75 to high school students. Now, my father was kind of, as I said, a mining engineer, responsible for laying the tracks, which required a great deal of trigonometry. When my two brothers were teenagers, he took each of them down into the mine for a week, and he said to them, "Now, this is what you do not want to do with your lives." Fortunately, my brothers, three of them, actually served in the services. It was peace time, toward the end of the war. Nevertheless, they got the benefits of the GI Bill. All three of them went into college. Two of them became engineers, one a chemical engineer, managed several plants for DuPont, the other an electrical engineer for GE, who became a nuclear engineer, and consulted in Japan, Germany. In other words, he became an international nuclear consultant. 

Interviewer: Wow.

Interviewee: And the third became a [inaudible 00:18:46] whose book I published. 

Interviewer: Yes, Francis, of course. 

Interviewee: Yeah, so as that war ended, coal wasn't needed, many men did take advantage of college with the GI Bill, and others who didn't would leave the area and would go to Philadelphia and otherwise they'd commute for the week and come home on weekends. That's how the economy changed. Actually, how the economy stands I'm not acquainted with. I mentioned the federal prisons, well I'm sure there are small, little industries, otherwise they would have disappeared.

Interviewer: Yeah. No, there's certainly there's something there. I wonder what it is. I'll have to look it up. All right, I think that's all I've got. 

Interviewee: That's good then. If you think of any...

Interviewer: Yeah, thanks for...oh. What's up?

Interviewee: I was gonna say, if you think of any other questions, but if you were to look up the names Frackville, Shenandoah, and Pottsville, maybe I'll put those in an email for you, and you can...

Interviewer: Yeah, that would be great. 

Interviewee: Yeah, and you can look up and get a little more feedback than what I...if you need to [inaudible 00:20:25] on that.

Interviewer: Yeah. No, I mean, it would just be good to see maybe pictures of it, and how it's changed across time. 

Interviewee: That's correct, right. Okay, well, I hope [inaudible 00:20:36]

Interviewer: All right. 

Interviewee: Okay, very nice talking to you. 

Interviewer: Yeah, it was nice talking to you, as well. 

Interviewee: Thank you.

Interviewer: I will probably see you soon, but take care until then.
