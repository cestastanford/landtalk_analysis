Vasundhara: Hi, good afternoon. 

Interviewee: Hi, Vasundhara, how are you doing?

Vasundhara: I'm doing well, grandma, how are you?

Interviewee: I'm very well too, thank you.

Vasundhara: Awesome. I wanted to just talk about, you know, a piece of land that's very familiar to you, which is your farmhouse and the lawns with it. It's for a class project and our main observation is to figure out how the land has changed over the last 30, 40 years. So, we'll take the timeline of 20 years and discuss that.

Interviewee: Oh, wonderful. That's a subject which is very close to my heart because, as you know, it's my passion and I've been looking after that place for the last 30, 40 years.

Vasundhara: I know. It's amazing. Okay. So, can you just talk a little bit about what the place is like and, you know, what it means to you and where it's located?

Interviewee: So, as you know, our farmhouse is located in India in a city called Kanpur. 

Vasundhara: Awesome. 

Interviewee: And we live in the farmhouse so we've maintained large gardens and large laws in the farmhouse around our house. 

Vasundhara: Awesome. 

Interviewee: And I've been looking after them. 

Vasundhara: That's really amazing. Can you tell me a little bit about, you know, what the place used to look like 20 years ago based on the photograph that you sent me?

Interviewee: Oh, okay. So, we have my observations from my earlier memories and the pictures of our farmhouse garden are somewhat like this. So, around 30 years ago, I would say, so let's start at 30 years ago because the changes have been gradual and over a period of time. So, around 30 years ago our garden had many more bushy [inaudible 00:01:41] shrubs and even though they were flowering or looking pretty, they grew in, sort of, a haphazard manner and were more difficult to maintain. So, over a period of time, they've been replaced with shrubs like ficuses which are evergreen but, sort of, easier to cut and give different shapes to, the purees and things like that. And they, definitely, do give a manicured look to our farmhouse garden.

Vasundhara: Awesome. It makes sense. Yeah. So, can you describe the main way in which the place has changed since then to now?

Interviewee: So, the main way that it's changed is that I would say it had a more natural look to it, you know, so many years ago, but because now things have changed, so it has a more manicured look, a lot of variety of palms from all over the, sort of, country and even other countries so have been placed in strategic corners to give a smarter, cleaner landscape look to the whole land area. So, it's basically a change in the kind of plants and the layout. So, the layout has changed completely, but this has happened like gradually over a period of time.

Vasundhara: Yeah. Over the last 20 years. That's really amazing that you guys have been able to make all those changes. I mean, I love the place. It's beautiful. 

Interviewee: Yeah. So, there are some more changes, if you want to discuss them. 

Vasundhara: Sure. I would love to hear more. 

Interviewee: Okay. So, now like, of course, this is because the maintenance was easier, that certain plants were removed and replaced, then there have been a lot of climatic changes, as you know, world over. So, they've taken place in India as well. And they have brought about changes in the kind of plants that used to thrive earlier and now. So, for example, do you know the crotons and the ferns? 

Vasundhara: Yeah. 

Interviewee: The beautiful, colorful crotons and a large variety of ferns could grow profusely about 30 years ago, but gradually they stopped doing well and the crotons would lose their color in the extreme hot, and extreme cold weather. So, there was no option but to, sort of, replace them with other varieties, which could take the extreme weather.

So, now we see much less of those plants. And there are newer, more hybrid, kind of, varieties which can thrive throughout the year. So, this we're talking about the permanent kind of plants. Then, there's also been a radical change in the flowering annuals which were planted twice every year. You know, depending on the weather, the summer took different kinds of plants. The winter had different kinds of plants. So, there's been a change in that. Earlier the seeds were, kind of, more natural. You know what I mean? Like a not genetically modified. 

Vasundhara: Yeah. 

Interviewee: And the annuals grew taller and bushier and though they were profuse and flowering and looked beautiful, there was a wilderness, I mean, a wild, natural look to the entire area.

Vasundhara: Yeah. And it's much more manicured now. I guess I could see that too. 

Interviewee: So, now you can see that from the pictures, you can see that that with the availability of hybrid…I mean, again, those hybrids are the genetically modified flowering annuals. 

Vasundhara: Right.

Interviewee: The plants are shorter and the flowering is profuse. So, as you can see, that it gives a very neat, manicured look to the garden. They are placed in, you know, color-coordinated manner now and according to the heights. So, you know, it depends on what you go for. The earlier look was beautiful too. Not necessarily, it was not nice. But, now naturally, but the addition of new things, we love to add new things to the garden.

Vasundhara: Yeah. That's amazing. Okay. That's some awesome feedback and definitely exactly what I was looking for. I guess I also just want to hear about your personal experiences like what would you say are some of the things that you used to do here, you know, 20 years ago versus what do you do here now?

Interviewee: You know, basically, we had a team of gardeners then, and we have a team of gardeners now. We still have a couple of old people and I oversee, you know, I spend two to three hours in the morning in the garden telling them what to do, how to do it. They've become experts now and they handle a lot of things on their own. But like, you know, how and where things have to be placed, how they have to be done. So, now they're trained in that and, sort of, I love spending time with, you know, there's so many butterflies and so many moths, and so many lovely birds. So, that's the natural part of it. And, I love spending time over there. 

Vasundhara: That makes sense. That's amazing.

Interviewee: I did that 30 years ago and I still do it 30 years later.

Vasundhara: Wow! So, you've spent the last 30 years doing the same thing in that land. That's truly amazing.

Interviewee: More or less, except that, you know, because the changes have been gradual. But I still have old memories of what the garden used to look like but it's changed radically now. We have a lot more, you know, kind of, manures available now, fertilizers. As you can see from the earlier photo, the grass is quite brown in the extreme summer and winter. But now with the help of these new fertilizers and manures available, it is kept green all through the year. Do you remember playing on the lawns when you were a child?

Vasundhara: I don't so much remember when I was super young, you know, like from when that photo is, for example, but I do remember like 10 years back. So, it's pretty amazing that… And, I mean, I agree, I could also just see how you guys have done a great job of, you know, just making it more beautiful and scenic. Like even just adding those, like, amazing statues and things like that that you got. When you travel, you know…

Interviewee: Yes. Yes. Those were placed when it became more landscaped and more manicured, so those statues and the bird bath scheme and all the additions that, you know…the availability of new things, new changes and new additions were made. Lights were put up highlighting the beautiful plants and the beautiful...

Vasundhara: The lights. That's right. 

Interviewee: So, we didn't have the lighting earlier.

Vasundhara: Yeah. I've also noticed like you guys make an effort to water every single plant, you know, per their needs and things like that. So, that's really special as well.

Interviewee: Oh yes. Oh yes. That's very important. That's very important. Certain plants need more water, certain don't. So, it takes up quite a bit of time, but it's a pleasure because, you know, it's a passion with me.

Vasundhara: That makes sense. That's amazing. That's honestly all the stuff I needed to hear for my class. So, I'm going to say bye now. Thank you so much for making the time.

Interviewee: Okay, Vasundhara, I hope the...
