Interviewer: Okay. So we're gonna start by you telling your first and last name. 

Novelis: Of course, of course. My first name is Novelis[SP]. My last name is Martay [SP]. Once again, that is Novelis Martay.

Interviewer: Okay. So this project is called the Land Talk, so basically...

Novelis: By the way, I'm a Northwestern Alumni. Look my up, Novelis Martay. I'm probably in the showcase with the basketball team championship, 2004.

Interviewer: Really?

Novelis: But that's another story. 

Interviewer: Really?

Novelis: Continue, continue. 

Interviewer: So this project is about seeing the differences in the Hyattsville, Maryland community, this area, and how it was 20 years ago regarding now and how you see and interpret the change. So my first question to you is do you remember when you moved here? 

Novelis: Yes. I do remember. It was actually right before school started. It was, like, early September 1997, right before I entered the fifth, yeah, right before I entered the fifth grade. That's when we moved here, September 1997.

Interviewer: What was your favorite part of living here? 

Novelis: My favorite part was...it was probably all the kids that lived in my neighborhood. It was a lot of kids, we moved into a, you know, kinda like a lower-middle-class, middle-class neighborhood. Black families, Spanish families, a couple of white families in the cut. But yeah, it was filled with a lot of kids my age, we all hung out a lot. Yeah, we just roamed the streets of our neighborhood. A lot of fun summers, we all grew up together pretty much. 

Interviewer: So did you like the bonds that you...like the bonds that you formed with your neighbors? 

Novelis: Actually, yeah. All of my neighbors I still to this day, I still speak to them every time, when I see them. They still know me. You know, most of them have...back when we first moved, their children were all babies or toddlers and now they're, like, in their early 20's so it's kind of weird seeing that, but yeah, we all have...we all still have a pretty good rapport with our neighbors. 

Interviewer: What kind of hobbies have you picked up since living here? 

Novelis: Hobbies that I picked up living in Maryland. Well basically the BMV area, yeah, up north in Boston, that's where we moved from, Boston, Massachusetts to Maryland. We had no idea, no clue what a gogo was. So when we moved to Maryland growing up in Maryland so close to D.C., we all adapted to that culture, the gogo culture, you know, the bands, the music, so that was one hobby. We all liked to go to shows, gogo shows. You know, backyard in UCB, Image. You probably don't know nothing about that. Other hobbies, this area, in particular, Hyattsville is an area where a lot of kids, grew up playing basketball. You know, football too, but my neighborhood, it was a neighborhood where everyone played basketball. We all competed against one another, everybody thought they were the best. So, you know, gogo, basketball, what else? Another thing in this area that, you know, you could call a hobby is...do I have money for the ice cream truck? No.

Jasmine: Yes.

Novelis: The way my bank account is set up, I don't have any money. So hold on, we're doing an interview right now. You gotta wait. 

Interviewer: Stop, wait, Jasmine.

Jasmine: Do you have money for me? 

Novelis: You gotta wait, this is my 15 minutes of fame, Jasmine. You gotta wait your turn to talk. 

Jasmine: I want ice cream. 

Interviewer: Okay, so next question. 

Novelis: Hold on, hold on. The third hobby, I didn't finish the third hobby. There was a...

Jasmine: Give me some money, Novelis.

Novelis: A lot of us like to rap. A lot of us growing up in this area, you know, you played...you went to school, you played basketball and you went to the studio and rapped. It was a good hobby, a fun hobby. 

Interviewer: Did you have any mixtapes or songs? 

Novelis: Nah, we was unsung, we was unsung artists. We never got the chance to...we did record a lot of songs and a few mixtapes, but nothing too serious. 

Interviewer: Okay, so how has this area changed in regards to, like, the weather, the environment, the people? Just, like, the surroundings in general. 

Novelis: Well it's developed, I can say that. The PG Mall area has been, you know, developed, renovated, whatever you want to call it, upgraded. You know, Hyattsville is more and more cultural in a sense. Back then it was more...we would see, you know, a lot of black people, a lot of...you'd see some white people. Nowadays, you know, you see a lot of more of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, you know, which is a good thing. It's a multicultural area. You got your Spanish folks, your black folks and your white folks. Yeah, I would say it's developed pretty well. 

Woman: You need to be quiet and calm down. 

Jasmine: Why? 

Woman: Because it's my homework, so be quiet. 

Jasmine: No it's not.

Interviewer: Okay, so what is the biggest difference that you have noticed?

Novelis: The biggest difference? I mean...

Interviewer: The weather, the houses, the people.

Novelis: The weather is pretty much the same to me. A lot of people think, you know, global warming is taking place. And yeah, I believe in global warming, but the summers are still hot, the winters are still cold. 

Jasmine: Oh my god. 

Novelis: You know, so...

Jasmine: I did...

Novelis: Jasmine. I was saying the weather has stayed pretty much the same. Like I said, they're developing more, they're building more townhouses, upgrading places like the mall and stuff, grocery stores. You know, they built the movie theater in the last, what...I think they built that 10 years ago, 5 years ago, something like that. I can't recall. But it's changing for the better, I can say that. 

Interviewer: What is the least difference that you've noticed?

Novelis: The least different? What do you mean? 

Interviewer: By that I mean, like, the biggest difference, what is something that you've noticed around that you haven't really seen any change in?

Novelis: Huh?

Jasmine: That hasn't changed. 

Novelis: You said streetlights? Streetlights are never gonna change. I mean...I see, I don't know if it's just because I'm getting older and I'm not home, but I see less children outside playing. That's a big difference that I've noticed. I see less kids outside riding bikes, less, you know, possies as you may call them. You know, we used to be outside hanging, we loved being outside back in the day. Nowadays a lot of kids, you know, they're brainwashed. Tablets, YouTube, so I guess that's a big change or a big difference that I've noticed. 

Jasmine: Phones.

Woman: Shut up. 

Novelis: But everything...you know what I'm saying, everything evolved. Culture has evolved, people have evolved. I haven't really seen a major change. Nothing negative, at least. Everything is evolving in a good way, in a positive way. 

Interviewer: Okay, last question. What is your favorite change that has happened over the last 20 years?

Novelis: My favorite change?

Interviewer: Or your least favorite?

Novelis: I guess it's seeing more...more...what's that word? More...seeing more families of different backgrounds, different races, owning more property, homes, you know? There used to be a time where it was just, you know, a certain, just white people basically owning property and stuff like that, but now you're seeing...like I mentioned earlier, you're seeing more black people owning properties, Spanish people. You know, and that's always a good thing in my book. People who I grew up with, we're all adults now, a lot of people are buying homes, owning their own businesses. So that's something good that I've noticed. 

Interviewer: Well that was it. Thank you so much for letting me interview you. 

Novelis: You are so welcome. Where do I send the invoice to? I prefer cash, but, you know, Cash App is cool. A good $20, $25 bucks would be cool. You know my Cash App by now, but yeah, this was fun. Thank you. 

Interviewer: You're welcome.
