Simon: [inaudible 00:00:01].

Julia: Cool. So my questions are pretty basic, but my first question is, I guess, just for context. When did you first move to San Francisco, and why?

Simon: So technically, I first moved here in '93 because the company I worked for was bought out by...so I'm gonna go very complicated. In '93, it was bought up. Bank of America bought [inaudible 00:00:26] bank, and I needed my job. So I think it weighed out. So I got moved up here, which was cool. So actually, I was here for a year. I moved back to L.A. because Bank of...mergers are never fun. [inaudible 00:00:40] working for a software company, and then I was like, "Oh, man. L.A. sucks." So, like, I called my boss and said, "Man, you got to help me get out of here," and then I got a job at Visa credit card company, and I moved back in November of '95.

Julia: Okay.

Simon: [inaudible 00:00:58] but technically '95. For sure, I've been here since '95.

Julia: Gotcha. So what was San Francisco like when you first moved there? Did it feel smaller? Or less crowded?

Simon: From my...This is how I would put it. I always considered San Francisco...I always said this to myself. It's like Disney Land for adults as long as you can afford to pay. And I mean so if it was expensive then, like...I would use an example. I think my studio apartment, which was all of 900 square feet, just under, was just over $2000 a month.

Julia: Oh, wow.

Simon: But the only reason...Yeah. I think it goes for like 35 now.

Julia: Goodness.

Simon: I weighed that versus I didn't want to be on the bridge every day driving [inaudible 00:01:51] city. So it was like, "No, you're gonna pay me now or pay me later." So that was then. Rent now? I mean I'm sure that [inaudible 00:02:02]. I mean you see people talking. It's obnoxious.

Julia: Yeah.

Simon: Yeah. I'll give you a real number. The house you've been in that we live in here...So this house cost in 19...Let's say 1997, $300,000.

Julia: Okay.

Simon: The houses on this block right now probably go for $1.3, $1.4 million.

Julia: Wow. That's insane.

Simon: And people pay cash.

Julia: Cash? Oh, my god.

Simon: But it's obviously folks who work for Facebook, Google, etc., etc., etc. They just pay cash. [inaudible 00:02:40]. That's the change. Smaller is...If it was already...I'll go on a tangent here. You can record me if you want, if it makes it easier. The population, as far as minorities, was always small being in the Mission District. When you come next time, I'll take you out to like Bay View, Hunters Point, to kind of...okay. That's where all the people of color live at. So it was always...it's even worse now. So I mean, it got worse since people had been pushed out. No one...I mean, what you read in the news. No one can afford to live in a city. I see it every day when Pat comes home. She's a school teacher. Probably 90% of the teachers that work at our school live, you know, in the east bay.

Julia: Okay.

Simon: Right? So they can't afford to live here, which, you know, adds stress to trying to do your everyday job, and it's just...the economics and the lack of housing is just more prevalent, and then the problem...you know, I would say the problem. The houses they're building is for people who can't afford it. You know?

Julia: Right.

Simon: So it's really more...they're all condos. So the city [inaudible 00:03:58] be quiet. So if a building was built new, like, on the corner of Mission and [inaudible 00:04:04]. There's a new condominium going up. So what the city will do is have a requirement that a certain percentage of those apartments and condos have to be a market rate, i.e. affordable.

Julia: Okay.

Simon: But that still isn't enough. You know?

Julia: Yeah. Interesting. Okay. My next...

Simon: I'm sorry. Did I answer your question?

Julia: Yeah, you did. You did. That was perfect. My next question is, what do you think San Francisco is like now? How has it changed? And how has what you did in San Francisco when you first moved there changed? Like, have the activities that you've done, like, in terms of work, things like that, how has that changed since you first moved there?

Simon: Just my observation in general, because I consider myself like, you know, an outsider. You know, I'm from L.A., but you know it's...I'd have to drive you around so you can kind of see what I'm talking about. The city is interesting. There's a huge resident...For the folks who have lived here forever and own their homes and things like that...I mean once you get outside of downtown, like where we live at, and you go farther towards the Pacific, I mean there are folks that have...There are communities out here. People have their houses and stuff like that. I guess I'm going back to where you see the build-out, the push-out. It's Bay View, Hunters Point, which is predominantly the African American community. People are being pushed out there. [inaudible 00:05:34], you know, China Town [inaudible 00:05:37]. You know? Mission District, number one, you know...My friend, you know...So a good friend of mine, his father started a bakery in the Mission District on the corner of 24th and...I don't know what street it is. It's been there like 50 years and [inaudible 00:05:59]. His family...His ex-wife...[inaudible 00:06:03] I'm rambling.

Julia: That's okay.

Simon: But anyway [inaudible 00:06:06] pushed out. I mean that had been here established, and they're the reason that people want to move here, because it's so cool of him, but the rents are being forced up. And in this particular example, here's a guy whose father started selling tamales out of his truck, you know, and somehow got, you know, worked his way to buy the building on this corner, you know, La Victoria Bakery, you know, been here 50, 60 years, you know, and established in the community. You know? Everyone loves, you know, [inaudible 00:06:33].  But now, he's gone because, you know, people sold out. It was bought out for money. You know?

Julia: Right.

Simon: And that's what's happening. People are just selling out. I don't know. I'm rambling. Sorry. I'm not answering your question.

Julia: No, that's good. That's good. So what was my last question? My last question for you is, is it a challenge? Or in the past, was it a challenge to find natural space in the city? Or is it especially so now? Or have things changed in terms of, like, finding natural space?

Simon: No. [inaudible 00:07:06]. No. I mean, the city is fascinating. It's lovely. The spaces are already here and things like that. I mean Golden Gate Park. You know, I mean it's Disney Land. I love to run. You know, I run from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate Bridge.

Julia: Yeah.

Simon: The Golden Gate Park is amazing. I mean, those spaces have been here. I mean, the city is great because, you know, if you can afford to live here...like, we have this little park in our own neighborhood, our own little private park. You know?

Julia: Yeah.

Simon: [inaudible 00:07:33]. Things like that. But what's interesting, in my humble opinion, is that, you know, San Francisco is only seven square miles. I mean, it's just small.

Julia: Oh, wow.

Simon: I think you could walk it in a day, literally. [inaudible 00:07:45] 49ers. The economic divide...we have kids, and these are kids that Pat teaches, who live like literally [inaudible 00:07:55] who have never seen the Golden Gate Bridge.

Julia: Really?

Simon: It's like people living in New Orleans and saying, "I've never seen the Mississippi."

Julia: Right.

Simon: You know? Or I've never seen the French Quarter. What do you mean? You live right here. But there's that...If there was already this economic social divide [inaudible 00:08:13]. It's gotten worse. You know? The city itself is still what it is, but the politics and the communities have changed drastically. So it's...You know, I see it every day. I see the Uber buses. I see, you know...The traditional businesses that had made San Francisco what it was, why it was so cool and hip to come see, become like [inaudible 00:08:41]. Okay. Oh, great. We got another Starbucks.

Julia: Yeah.  Yeah. 

Simon: [inaudible 00:08:45]. You know? So it's real...I don't know. I hope I'm answering your question.
