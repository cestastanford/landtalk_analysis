Interviewer: Grandpa, remember. No cussing, all right?

Grandpa: [inaudible 00:00:03] 

Interviewer: All right. Sounds good. Well, anyway. So, just to give you a background on the project... So, we have to interview you guys, or someone who's lived in the same spot for 20 years. And, I remember, whenever I came to visit you guys...this past time, we were looking at those tornado pictures, so I know that was kind of the big event. But, kind of an overarching deal...can you give your perspective on, really like, your backyard, the ponds you have in your house. Like, wildlife, has it, like, increased, decreased? Has vegetation increased, decreased? Stuff like that. And then you guys can just take turns and talk about it. That'd be great. 

Grandma: What kind time frame are you talking about? In the last five years? 10? 15?

Interviewer: Twenty. Last 20. 

Grandpa: Well, we've been here 25, 30 something. Hey, you know what? [inaudible 00:01:04] 

Interviewer: All right. Well, then talk about the last 30, grandpa. 

Grandpa: Huh?

Interviewer: You can talk about the last 30 or something, then. 

Grandpa: Yeah.

Grandma: Okay. [inaudible 00:01:12] that you have. 

Interviewer: Oh, really?

Grandpa: Well, I came here. This house was, kind of, not too good. And it had, like, three washes coming in from the North Side, and I took all the trees out of them. Till [SP] them all up. And when they built the house the first time, there was a lot of trees and stuff [inaudible 00:01:41], and I cleaned that all up. And the same thing between me and the house at [inaudible 00:01:46] corner. I cleaned that up. And planted, just, sod grass. I didn't put any grass sod down. And then, the ponds were already there, but the one on the left side, we dug it out bigger. And it's mostly a foot deep, but now that pond's probably all about four foot deep. It's filled in from the water running in off the side of the hill, here. We always making new dirt, everywhere. Where the dirt come from?

Interviewer: Where did dirt come from?

Grandpa: Yeah. Where's this dirt come from? 

Interviewer: I don't know, grandpa. You tell me. 

Grandpa: Well five billion years ago, the rocks come out of the...out in the...wherever out there. And they start clanging together. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And they did that for about five million years ago. Earth about as big as it was, but it wasn't nothing but granite rock. Granite...was no dirt. And then after it came together, it made volcanoes. And the volcanoes came from melting the rock inside and blowing it up. And it's black, you know. So, you ever seen volcanic rock? It's black. In Russia, [inaudible 00:03:09] about 900 miles wide and hundreds of feet deep in Eastern Russia. And, of course, here in California, there's black dirt on the side of the road. You see it. That's volcanic rock. Now, we got the granite, and then we had this melting coming out of the ground, now. We still ain't got no dirt yet. So, then when the Earth's cooled off, the water that was out in the atmosphere turned solid and landed on the Earth. Are you recording this or writing this down?

Interviewer: Oh, I'm writing this down, grandpa. I'm listening. 

Grandpa: Am I going too fast?

Interviewer: No. No, you're going good. I want you to focus on the house more, but yeah, this is good, right here. 

Grandpa: [inaudible 00:03:52] 

Interviewer: All right. 

Grandpa: And then, when the water came down, it pushed the rock off, one grain of rock at a time. So, that's where all dirt, lose, and little stuff came from. From those two there. So, we got the dirt here, but we have rock right underneath it. So, therefore the ground can shift from earthquakes. Not a lot, but it does. Here, a year ago, I was gonna go get this thing ready to go, and I fixed about 50, 60 places where they come apart. Because it may chip apart. 

Interviewer: Yeah, from all that earthquake [inaudible 00:04:41].

Grandpa: So, now, the water comes down off the hill, it comes down and then the dirt goes in the pond on the north side. The north side one's filling up. The other one stays pretty full all the time. And now, [inaudible 00:04:54] something. Tell him something else. 

Grandma: Are you through telling him how dirt got here?

Grandpa: Yeah, yeah. How we got it on the hill. 

Grandma: Okay. We, here over the last...about 20 years ago, he hauled in a bunch of dirt to help level out the area, because we had lost so much, and most of what we have here is underneath this rock. So, even the [inaudible 00:05:19] grow. We had to add some more. But we've also, with the rains and the different things, you've got more washes. And we've got areas that have had the water and stuff wash away. 

Grandpa: So, also now, for cause of that reason, I planted a lot of trees, and probably 35 or 40 of them have died. Because they start getting big, their roots grow out bigger and bigger, and they fight over the water and the soil that's here, and so then one of them would die and another one would die. They spacing themselves out for them own selves to die. The dirt's moving down to the south side of this piece of property, but the water runs south side. So, dirt moves around all the time on there, from the water and the rain, you know, and what makes the things go. 

Interviewer: So, can you speak to, like, the tornado? I know it hit you guys' house. But the land itself that you guys are on, did it do, like, a ton of damage? And then, depending on the damage, did you see a natural recovery or anything happening after the tornado?

Grandma: Well, one of the things...there were willow trees all the way around the big pond right in the front of the house and the Eastside. And those [inaudible 00:06:51]. Some of them recovered, but most of them did not, and [inaudible 00:06:59]. And oak trees and some of the big trees in the back were beaten up really pretty bad. Some of them came back, some of them did not, and we ended up planting some additional trees [crosstalk 00:07:16]. 

Grandpa: Also, as time changes, Rudy Fouts [SP]...you know, my old buddy's dead now. He had a big [inaudible 00:07:24] down at 193rd and Admiral, right there by the Casino and looking south to Broken Arrow. There's about 10 of them sitting on horses, which they're cowboys, and you know there wasn't a tree between here and broken arrow. Can you imagine that?

Interviewer: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. 

Grandpa: Because a hectare is what we got here. A hectare has berry [inaudible 00:07:47] about 500 berries in each little hackberry. It has a million of them around. And the Indians used to burn it all off. So, they let that crap...they had more damn brains than we did. They'd burn the whole country off, get rid of all the trees. And so, we let them all grow up, and they try to grow over everything. And that don't take a lot of water to keep getting in there, because they got themselves used to growing, kind of, on a real thin soil that go down to the rock. Can't go any further. Now, a pine tree, if I see somebody plant them, I just laugh. I hate them, because they is all over Mississippi and Alabama. There's a lot of dirt there. They go down about two, three feet, that much, they hit the rock, and you know what happens? They die.

Interviewer: They die. 

Grandpa: Because they don't have any water. Yeah. That's why I get on them, the stupid bastards shouldn't have put it on there. Shouldn't say stuff like that, should you? 

Interviewer: Well...

Grandpa: So, you write that out. Now, the wind blows here, pretty good. And it's quite often. [inaudible 00:08:50] if I'm sitting here and looking out back, and all the deer, you'll see them take off and runoff, and the birds will fly off. That means that the tornadoes are coming. They don't have weather people or weather birds, but they know when it's coming. So, they leave. And then, if it just blows, and it's gonna be a rainy deal, and they don't go. They know when it's not a tornado. They know that by the rain itself. And how, I have no idea. But I just seen it done over and over and over. You say, "Look at them leaving. Tornado somewhere coming close." [inaudible 00:09:23] get here. 

Interviewer: So, I remember, I think...what was it? Like five or six years ago, Oklahoma went through a huge drought, right? 

Grandpa: [inaudible 00:09:34] 

Interviewer: Remember, the ponds kind of dried up a little bit? Can you speak to some changes you saw when that happened, and then how it's recovered to now?

Grandma: [inaudible 00:09:44] Those years, you know, [inaudible 00:09:47] totally dried up. And the one right here in front of the house went down, what, six or seven feet. It didn't get totally dry because it's a lot deeper and, I guess, has a better water source. And then, as we've had various rains and stuff, they filled back up. And it's been halfway full for the last couple of years. But in dry years...then, we don't have the perfect lawn, because we don't water like your parents do. So, we lose trees and some plant life [inaudible 00:10:26] watering. In fact, a couple of years ago, when we had the really dry time and we had a lot of sun, then some of our trees out there died. It was almost like a sunburn on the west side of them and caused some problems. And we lost some of them to whatever disease comes up from there. 

Grandpa: I never seen... Oak trees. I never knew how... But you know what a sperm looks like? It comes out of you, a little round thing [crosstalk 00:10:57]?

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Grandpa: Well, the same kind of little [inaudible 00:11:01] was underneath the oak tree barks and just killed the hell out of them. The [inaudible 00:11:07] maybe 10,000 of the things.

Interviewer: Yeah, just like a pesticide or something like that. Yeah.

Grandpa: And they crawl up where the bark is and not where the tree is. It's at the [inaudible 00:11:17]...

Grandma: Up on the branches. 

Grandpa: In between there. And they climb up to that in-between, there, and killed... Smokes, I never seen that. There was a 40 acre Island somewhere up on Grand Lake [SP]. They said, they killed all the oak trees of-of there. Because that's a change of weather. I've never seen that, just a weather thing. And of course, now we have more...well, it's kinda funny, you know. The world they said it's getting hotter, and they said that it's getting colder. But I've seen the data, and the last ice age was 15 what? Sorry. Twenty-two thousand years ago? And it got over with about 11,000 years ago. But then, I looked in the data I read and stuff. In the Milky Way, the Earth and the Sun, we go from one side of it to the other. It takes 22,000 years. And then we turn around and come back to the other side in 22,000 years, and the weather changes a hugely amount, each time. Then, we go back up again. We do that over and over and over. Now, the trees... You remember when the violins in England, whatever, Stradivarius, and they was all...you know, you hear about them. They was all great. 

Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

Grandpa: Why was they so great? You know. And finally, we figured it out. They had a dry period there of 10, 20 years. And when a tree grows, it's got the hard part and the soft part and a hard part. If it's wet, it grows real wide. It's got a lot of soft part in there. But for that length of time that those violins are made, it was real dry and it was real narrow, so the wood was a lot harder what was actually there. So, that's where that wood came from to make those fancy violins. Because it didn't rain. And that's been 100 years ago or 200 years ago. Somewhere back then. 

Interviewer: [inaudible 00:13:10] 

Grandpa: But we get good stuff, you know. What now. But we're talking about [inaudible 00:13:13]. weather's getting hotter, right? 

Grandma: [inaudible 00:13:18] 

Grandpa: And we've put out carbon...

Interviewer: [inaudible 00:13:21] Yeah.

Grandpa: Carbon...monoxide? What do we put out?

Grandma: Dioxide. 

Interviewer: Dioxide. 

Grandpa: What?

Grandma: Carbon dioxide.

Interviewer: Carbon dioxide, C-O-2. 

Grandpa: And that, [inaudible 00:13:30], that how trees, all the world [inaudible 00:13:32]. That's what makes their leaves, where it comes from. So, have we looked out and seen the leaves and greenery start getting greener? 

Interviewer: Have you?

Grandpa: They should. That's what the scientists tell us. You had to listen to it. Or there maybe some BS right in there, somewhere. See? 

Interviewer: I hear you. 

Grandpa: But every 22,000 years, we go from one side of the Milky Way, and then we turn around and go back the other way. Every time we go, the water, it quits raining. It gets dry, dry, dry, dry. We turn around and go back the other way. Then, it starts raining and it all comes back again. So, this is something. But, yeah, scientists like to say, "Oh, last year, you know, five years and 10 years and 20 years..." That ain't nothing but the length of time the Earth been here, we have 5 billion years as changes for different things, that length of time. [inaudible 00:14:21] blew into the and whatever. Outside within the atmosphere or our atmosphere and the Milky Way and the Earth. And so, we have this changing that goes on all the time. So, in 22,000 years from now, it'll change back again as we go back to the other side. But they don't ever tell you that, though, do you? You never seen that?

Grandma: Okay. That's not what [inaudible 00:14:44] is asking. 

Grandpa: Okay.

Interviewer: No, that's all good. It's all good. It's all good. That was good. 

Grandpa: Let's get back on that [inaudible 00:14:49] here, then. 

Interviewer: Well, yeah, just to conclude, because it's supposed to be relatively short. So, just like, you house today, kind of like, what's new? What do you see, like, happening in the environment outside? Because I know you guys do pay attention a lot to that backyard area. So, if there's a couple things that kinda stick out. 

Grandma: Oh yeah. We [inaudible 00:15:11] the animals and stuff. Yes. 

Interviewer: Yeah, but is there a couple of things that you see growing more, something that's not growing like it would in the past, or just some trends that you see? Or just, kinda, the same old?

Grandpa: Since we're here, we let the trees grow back. They grow back, all the time. And the Indians had to burn off, all the time. And that's just a very short time. So, my point is, the change is so little that we do not have the ability to say we're getting hotter or colder, even though we got a half a degree up, a half down. Most of that's BS, it's been doing this forever. So, you're gonna go back to ice age. Another 20,000 years of ice age, again, and ice will take back over the country, finally. 

Interviewer: Yeah. Well, grandma... Yeah.

Grandma: Okay. What you're saying about our [inaudible 00:16:10] stuff around [inaudible 00:16:12] is [inaudible 00:16:15] have so much shade that the...I don't grow grass very well underneath [inaudible 00:16:20] cut the tree limbs up high, but it's still...the [inaudible 00:16:24] has enough nutrient in the soil, but the [inaudible 00:16:26] a lot of extra watering up to that point. And the, whatever, greenery or whatever I have here in my front fence, it depends on how much I water. As to whether it grows, I haven't seen a whole lot of difference in it, in that particular way. Or when we have not seen any particular diseases come through for the trees over the years, once we got through whatever came through. It must be about 10, 12 years ago when the oak trees around town wound up developing this...it looks like arthritis where the little buds got in out on the branches and stuff to do that. But it's one of the things that kind of pass through at different times. I don't know whether the birds...or just the parasites didn't show up. I'm sure that they were brought in from somewhere. We need more birds now, in our backyard. And we have a bird feeder out there. And it's been mild the last couple of winters, so they don't all head south, they kind of winger [SP] around here. 

Interviewer: Got it. 

Grandpa: And then, only long term thing I can tell you...when I was a kid, the cotton grew in...
