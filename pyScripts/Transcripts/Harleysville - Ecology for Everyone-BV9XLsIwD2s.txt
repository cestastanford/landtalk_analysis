Kim: Hi, this is Kim Buchanan.

Ryan: Hi, this is Ryan Buchanan. And this is the interview about a certain place that...it is about the way [inaudible 00:00:15]. So what is the name of the location that you will be speaking about?

Kim: The homestead in Harleysville, Pennsylvania.

Ryan: Okay and the latitude and longitude are 40 degrees, 0.275 north and 75 degrees, 0.387 west. So mum, how does this place look before when you first got here?

Kim: When I first got here, this was actually an orchard owned by the Rittenhouses. It was nothing but farmland, which they had peach crops and apple trees, a big pond on it and it was nothing but a big, big, huge farm.

Ryan: Okay, so pretty much mostly farmland?

Kim: Yes.

Ryan: How exactly has it changed in the past couple of years, at least the 20 years that you have been here?

Kim: It is changed where now there is a development of more than 100 homes, approximately anywhere between 1,800 square feet to 3,600 square feet, each with a lot size between a third of an acre to a half of an acre. There are a lot more roads. There are many more shops. There are restaurants, traffic lights, significant increase in traffic lights. Even getting to this place, there are an extra exit on the turnpike. They are widening the northeastern extension of the turnpike to accommodate all of the people in the area. So it's grown significantly since it was farmland.

Ryan: Okay, so obviously it has changed a lot. It's become more civilized than the farmland and more used up. So what are the things you used to do here before when it was less overtaken by I guess human population?

Kim: Well, we would pick apples at the orchard, pick peaches at the orchard, just enjoying nature, watch the deer. It actually borders between two different townships. We would just go fishing in the pond and really just kind of enjoy nature.

Ryan: Okay. And so, what are the things that have changed? So what are the things that you do now?

Kim: Well, there's a walking path and that's about it. There's no orchard for picking of fruit. There's really no fishing in the pond anymore. There are more restaurants, eateries, pizzas, grocery stores, Walmarts, restaurants, gas stations. It's more commercialized versus more country.

Ryan: Right, thank you very much, mum.

Kim: All right.

Ryan: Hope you have a great day.

Kim: Thanks, bye-bye.
