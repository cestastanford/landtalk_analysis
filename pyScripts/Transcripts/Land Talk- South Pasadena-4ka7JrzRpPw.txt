Sam: My name is Sam Ota. And I'm going to talk about the city of South Pasadena. The latitude and longitude are 34.1161 degrees north and 118.1503 degrees west.

Interviewer: How did this place look before?

Sam: South Pasadena is an old town. It was incorporated in 1888. It has a diverse landscape within the three square miles, it has hills. It has a valley. It has a river. It also has sort of like a forestry area. All are tree lined streets with old Craftsman homes. But the thing you notice about South Pasadena or that I noticed about South Pasadena was its beauty with its many trees and wildlife. There were parrots, coyotes, peacocks, hawks, and owls that I've seen. The weather here is usually...it's mild. The summers are hot and the winters aren't very cool.

Interviewer: And how has it changed?

Sam: There's been some development in the town since we've been here, the last 20 years. And I think the development has caused some trees to be cut down. We also had a severe wind storm in 2012. Lots of trees fell down. And on top of that, recently we've had the drought. And so, the greenery in the town has, due to water conservation efforts, become very brown. And people have changed their landscape from grass to sort of like a desert theme yards. And so, it's become a little browner and a little less beautiful.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you used to do here?

Sam: Well, because of its diverse landscape, there's lots to do like hiking and biking, walking along the river, doing things like that, going for jobs. I've done all those things and I've enjoyed doing that.

Interviewer: And what are some of the things you do here now?

Sam: I still do the very same things that I just mentioned. Probably the thing I noticed, though, is that as previously mentioned, it's a little less green, and therefore maybe not as beautiful as it used to be.
