Interviewer: Perfect. I'm recording now. So, hi. How are you?

Interviewee: Hello. I'm just fine. How are you?

Interviewer: I'm doing excellent. Could you tell me where you're from?

Interviewee: Where I currently live?

Interviewer: That's it. Perfect. Exactly, fantastic.

Interviewee: San Francisco.

Interviewer: San Francisco, the Bay Area. Have you been there for over 20 years, by any chance?

Interviewee: I have. Yes, I've been in San Francisco for 23 years, 23 and a half years.

Interviewer: Quite a stretch.

Interviewee: And the Bay Area for a long time, 40 years.

Interviewer: You must have noticed some really interesting changes in this time. Are there any observations that spring to mind about how this location used to look?

Interviewee: I think not necessarily how it used to look. The one thing that really stands out to me is in the area of Twin Peaks in San Francisco. It used to be really, really foggy and the fog has kind of dissipated over the years. It's not sucked in like it used to be and I've heard that from people who've lived here even longer than me that it used to be, you couldn't see it from the Castro and now, the thickness of the fog isn't as intense as it used to be.

Interviewer: And right now it's different?

Interviewee: It is. It's less... You see less fog throughout the year than you used to.

Interviewer: Interesting. Are there certain activities that you used to do here that perhaps you no longer do?

Interviewee: No. I don't think so. I think one of the things that I have noticed is like, at Ocean Beach, the waves, it seems to be more intense in the winter than it used to be. Like, the waves, you get some really, really powerful waves and high waves. A lot more, I think, surf advisories than you used to get. So I've definitely noticed that and even the dunes, the sand dunes seem to...it seems to have eroded more along the beach than when we first moved here.

Interviewer: Interesting. Have you noticed any changes in terms of wildlife, perhaps native species that used to be there and no longer are or perhaps species that are in prominence now, but did not used to be present?

Interviewee: I think what I've noticed is a lot more coyotes that seem to be more prevalent in Golden Gate Park than 20 years ago. Yeah. And there's signs posted now that were never posted 20 years ago that I certainly don't remember any. So a lot more coyotes. I think that's it from a wildlife perspective that I can think of.

Interviewer: Interesting. Are there any activities that you used to take part in in the region that you were perhaps no longer doing or are there new activities that you can engage in now?

Interviewee: No. I think we've been mountain biking, you know, for 20 years and we continue to do that. I don't really notice a difference. We do a lot of things in the park now on paths there and I haven't really noticed a difference as much. I guess one of the things we do see is probably a lot more homeless shelters in the parks than we used to see.

Interviewer: Interesting.

Interviewee: Not necessarily ecological, but it does affect the environment to a degree.

Interviewer: Definitely. Well, thank you so much for your time. This is fantastic and I look forward to speaking to you again.

Interviewee: Okay. Thank you.

Interviewer: Of course. Have a good day.

Interviewee: You too. Bye.

Interviewer: Bye.
