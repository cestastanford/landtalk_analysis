Courtney: Hi, my name is Courtney Richardson. I'm here with Tamika Richardson. And we're gonna talk about how the area of the District of Columbia has changed. What do you remember when you first moved here?

Tamika: When I first moved to the District of Columbia, I came in for the summer to visit in 1986. And I recall, it was culture shock. I came from the Dallas, Texas area. And being in DC, it was considered the murder capital of the world during that time.

Courtney: What is your favorite part about living in DC?

Tamika: I love DC being a area of convenience. The heart of the city is really just that. I mean, you can get to any other part of the city really quickly. The Metro was state of the art during that time period. And I just loved all of those type of conveniences that it offered.

Courtney: Has there been any big storm in the last 20 years to the District of Columbia?

Tamika: Storm?

Courtney: Like, hurricanes, like, you know, like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, and stuff like that?

Tamika: We haven't had anything as severe as the Hurricane Katrina or those other major hurricanes. But not quite sure that this was inside the District of Columbia city limits, but I do recall a tornado at least hitting the College Park area, so it was just outside of the District of Columbia. And that was probably in the late '90s when I first recall that incident, maybe early 2000. 

Courtney: Can you tell me more about that?

Tamika: I remember during this time, I was living in Laurel, and I was actually pregnant with my first child, Courtney. And we were driving down Route One coming from my work in the District of Columbia. And the tornado was actually coming right behind us. By the time we got home, I had seen on the news or report that said that the tornado was coming through DC to College Park, and then actually did some kinda ruin area in the University of Maryland route. 

Courtney: That's really interesting. 

Tamika: Two people passed away. Yeah.

Courtney: Oh, that's so sad. How has the people change from [inaudible 00:02:25] then to now?

Tamika: To me, the people have changed a lot. The culture of the city was majority black when I first arrived in the '80s. It was a drug kind of driven town, you know, it's a lot of drug activity. And now, there's so much diversity. I mean, I feel like the District of Columbia is a melting pot. It has people from all different cultures that are there. You have people from different nationalities and just everywhere. Currently, you can see the robust number of, what do you call it, you can see the robust number of Anglo-Saxons who have now kind of, like, started to live in the area that are more millennials, you know? They're willing to come in and kinda change the face of what the District of Columbia looks like. They're willing to live in any part of the city, as a matter of fact, they're not restricted in any one area, but they will put down their roots, and they will gut a house like nobody's business.

Courtney: What do you like most about living here now?

Tamika: I love being in the city. I feel like I grew up as a country girl, and I know all about, you know, thee country slow paced type of life. But I think for me, I have thrived more in an environment where it's fast paced, where you have more access to jobs, when you have more access to different opportunities, whether that's education in school, college, what have you, everything that this area affords you. That's what I love. And that's what I would just like to continue to be a part of.

Courtney: What do you miss about the things that you guys had in the past that have changed?

Tamika: It's hard to say. I don't think I miss much.

Courtney: That's okay. 

Tamika: Okay. 

Courtney: What kinda animals have you seen, like, around the area that's new that you don't see, I guess, in the past. 

Tamika: I think for me, it's very interesting that with this gentrification, not just in the city but also outside of the city, there are more deer, and wolves, and bears, have populated the area. And they are part of our common space, meaning in our backyards, whereas before, you will probably never see them unless you go further out, or further down south, or what have you. So I think that's very interesting. 

Courtney: What kinda hobbies have you picked up? 

Tamika: For me, I really enjoyed reading. And I've done that for probably all of my life. I think my most recent hobby I've picked up is yoga. It gives me time to meditate and kind of focus. And I really enjoy doing that.

Courtney: Have you ever been to the yoga in the mall?

Tamika: I have not. I heard about it and it's something I definitely would be interested in exploring.

Courtney: Well, thank you, Tamika, for interviewing with me. It was very was much appreciated. 

Tamika: You're very welcome. 

Courtney: Bye-bye.

Tamika: Bye.
