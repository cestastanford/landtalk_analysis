There used to be a tree in the middle of the backyard here and another tree that a basketball hoop was on. You see the old garage and the picnic table back here, and there aren't a whole lot of plants or anything, and there's no fence dividing the yards. Now there's a white picket fence that divides the yards. The tree that was in the middle of the backyard and the one that had the basketball hoop on it have been removed, and there are two new garages back here. 

And then back here, there's a flower garden with all kinds of flowers. And in the foreground here in front of the white picket fence, there's a rose garden. It's, yeah, it's changed, obviously, dramatically. There's also a new deck that was put in here, and as you can see, a number of the trees in the background have been removed and then, again, there's a number of plants in this bush here in the foreground, and the white picket fence.

This is the house here. This was the house next door to me when I was growing up, and we used to play baseball in the backyard, and a lot of the times, we'd use this yard as well to go over there. And it was a lot of fun and a lot of fond memories playing baseball back there. My oldest sister actually has moved into the house that I grew up in, and so mainly I'll go to visit her and just brings back a lot of good memories. And, you know, I think what they've done to change the environment with the white picket fence, they now have a pool, and just all the flowers and vegetation that they've added, it's really a beautiful place and just brings back a lot of good memories.
