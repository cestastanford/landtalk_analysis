Interviewer: So when did you first come to Palo Alto?

Interviewee: I first came out to Palo Alto in 1986. I was a kid who grew up in New Hampshire and I came out to Stanford as a freshman and undergraduate.

Interviewer: And when you first came to Palo Alto, what were your impressions of it?

Interviewee: Well, my impressions were largely dictated by the experiences that I had prior to getting to Stanford. I grew up in a little town in New Hampshire called Hollis, New Hampshire. And Hollis was a very farm-like environment. There were lots of fields and lots of cows and lots of pigs. And when I got to Stanford, it felt quite metropolitan to me. It felt like it was a kind of a big city-like experience. The Palo Alto was a big city. And,  I was guessing, I guess I was kind of like a little hick moving to the big city.

Interviewer: And so now that you've lived here for, in Palo Alto, for a pretty decent number of years, how has the land and landscape changed since you first came to Stanford and Palo Alto and now?

Interviewee: Well, I guess I figured out that Stanford wasn't quite the metropolis I thought it was, having then spent summers in real cities. I realized that actually Stanford and Palo Alto, we're pretty small towns. The University Ave downtown when I got to Stanford in 86 was lots of small businesses, local businesses. California Avenue was even more kinda little townie and Stanford itself was a pretty small compact institution relative to what it is today. I guess I don't mean compact in the sense that it fit over a smaller amount of land. I mean, one of the nice things that Stanford has always had going for it is that it has a lot of land, but it had a far fewer buildings. And they were, you know, there was just not the degree of specialization there is today. And so the evolution has been pretty dramatic.

I lived at Stanford at an Undergrad from 1986 to 1990 and then I left and went to law school and lived in New York for a while. In 1997, I returned. So I guess I was gone for seven years and I've been back for since 1997 so for the last 22. And both Palo Alto and Stanford have grown pretty dramatically. There've been lots of changes, I suppose. You know, most significantly there have been a huge number of buildings that have been built both in Palo Alto and at Stanford. If you look at what's happened on El Camino, the Palo Alto city council made it their priority to do what they called fronting El Camino by building these bigger buildings that were just sort of sit alongside El Camino and create a corridor. And as a result, we have a bunch more office building, like buildings on El Camino now. And then Stanford itself has changed quite dramatically. 

When I got to Stanford, there was no science and tech quad. There was none of the, you know, the hospital was probably a fraction of the size. You yourself have seen the children's hospital get built and it's a massive undertaking. So they're just a been a huge number of changes over that period of time. But I have to say the most significant change, the one that I've experienced that's had the greatest impact on my understanding and appreciation of Stanford has been the now near constant imposition of the rotary all around Stanford's campus. That has been the most dramatic change.

Interviewer: That's very interesting. There are a lot of them on campus. Other than the change and well, the change of the rotary, have you noticed any other big differences to the campus? Like Lake Log? Was that ever a lake?

Interviewee: Yeah. Funny you should mention that. Thank you. It turns out that there is a reason that Lake Log is called Lake Log and that is because when I was at Stanford, it was a lake. It was not a dirt pit. Now, it should be called Dirt Pit log. But when I was here after the winter, they'd be the rainy season and the Lake Log would kind of fill up partially and then as spring rolled around and they fill it up the rest of the way. And I don't actually know what by what means, but they would actually fill Lake Log and you could take wind surfing classes on Lake Log. It was one of the most sought-after classes at Stanford when I was an Undergrad and people would hang out by the lake and people would go boating that you'd go, you know, rowing, etc out on the lake.

It was great actually. And unfortunately, over time we had some droughts that made it unecological to have this Lake Log filled. And then there was even a period of time when the fountains around campus, we're not being filled with water because it was bad for the environment. So we've certainly seen that change. I frankly think that either Lake Log needs to be I guess there's a problem in that there are some species that they don't wanna interfere with because otherwise I would kind of say time to make Lake Log, some dorms. But right now it's just the dust bowl log.

Interviewer: Yes. And I understand that you're involved in some ways in planning for the future expansion of Stanford. Can you tell me a little more about how you anticipate the changing of Stanford in the future?

Interviewee: Well, I guess I'd start by saying to the degree that I'm involved in is quite tangential. I wouldn't say that I am one of the principle architects of the future of Stanford's land use, but I do have the good fortune of being involved in some of the conversations as Stanford thinks through its expansion. Stanford is currently in the process of negotiating the GUP, which is the General Use Permit that it, that it engages in with the local cities. So Stanford owns land across many of the towns that surround it. And rather than having to negotiate individual building permits every time it wants to build yet another Ariaga gym, they do this general use permit where they plan for five years of expansion and negotiate broadly all of those things. And then it's approved and then they don't have to, you know, get individual permits.

And so I've been involved in those conversations, which are quite interesting. Obviously Stanford does intend to continue to build a number of buildings. Now you can imagine that one of the biggest pieces of the most recent GUP, and one of the things that, that has had created some controversy is this gigantic building that they're building now in Escondido for graduate housing that's adding thousands of beds and is... They're also digging gigantic parking lots. And so the local community is concerned about traffic and how that will be impacted as Stanford continues to expand its graduate population. And then the other thing that's in consideration and will be an interesting question going forward is does Stanford increase its undergraduate population? I think that all of the, you know, sort of top institutions in the country are contemplating the question of how they should or might increase their populations as the admissions rate has gotten so astronomically low.

I wonder if that's a thing. Can you be astronomically low? Anyway, as the admissions rate has dropped dramatically, all of these institutions are trying to figure out how to contemplate increasing the undergraduate population. And so, you know, as they think through that, you can imagine that that has a lot of implications. And the most significant implication is that if you wanna bring more undergraduates to campus, you need to have more undergraduate housing. So how will you contemplate that? And if you do then increase the undergraduate population, what will you do around additional professors, additional classrooms, additional facilities, more gyms, more, you know, theaters. You just need everything. So I would anticipate that as we think about these questions, Stanford will continue to grow and expand in it's existing space. And that we'll put a bunch of pressure on the land as it's been used over these many decades.

Interviewer: Yeah. If I'm still around, I hope to see those changes and I definitely have noticed the big building of the graduate housing when biking by. It's created a lot of dust making it a little difficult to see when biking. Anyways, thanks so much for taking your time and chatting with me about Stanford and Palo Alto and its changes and I appreciate your points of view.

Interviewee: My great pleasure.
