Interviewee: Okay.

Interviewer: All right. So the first question is just kind of describe the way the place used to look and also mention what place you're referring to.

Interviewee: Okay. Well, growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and living very close to the water and also close to the Endowment Lands which is a large tree-ed area with trails and stuff like that and also being very close to the main part of the city, things changed dramatically over the years that I have been there. And where there was low density type housing, single-family home lots, a mixture of different types of economic groups living in the community or neighborhood to Vancouver becoming a much more largely populated city, higher density, and the area that I grew up because its desirability changing to where it became a very exclusive neighborhood with the wealthy people.

Interviewer: Yeah, that's awesome. And you kind of touched on my next question and that would be how the place has changed over time. If you have anything to add to how you originally described the environment in Vancouver you can totally add.

Interviewee: Yeah, so it changed over time. More people, crowded conditions, people not being as friendly and the lifestyle not as easygoing, more hustle and bustle city-types life. And with the changes in ethnicity too, a lot of changes to just the way people treated the environment to the type of homes they built to cutting down trees or impacting their dues and wanting to use things like that. I don't know if that's what you're looking for.

Interviewer: No, no, that was perfect. Yeah, and then...

Interviewee: Do you want me to expand on any of that stuff?

Interviewer: Yeah, if you'd like to. As far as like the environmental impact that having more people has created in Vancouver, could you add a little more to that?

Interviewee: Sure, so the environmental impact...your uncle Leon, he used to go down to the beach and smelt fish. He'd put out a net and catch smelts and we used to eat them. We used to crab too. We had a crab trap, and we'd just get crabs straight out of the ocean. And the ocean was relatively clean and clear, but with the increase in population and, really, the lack of proper infrastructure in place to deal with sewage, a lot of that sewage was being dumped out raw into the ocean and it killed much of the fish life and plant life in the city area and you couldn't eat those fish and shellfish anymore. And also people started crabbing a lot and wiped out the crab populations, I'd say, entirely to sell in their restaurants to the people, but the crabs were actually toxic and shouldn't have been...anybody who'd eat them. But that's kinda one impact. So just the population increase and the lack of proper sewage treatment affected the ocean area and the coastlines just out of the city that we once, you know, could fish and eat from.

Interviewer: Yeah. That was a perfect answer. Earlier you mentioned stuff about the Endowment Lands and growing up near there and being able to go there all the time. And that's something that has been protected and not impacted as much by this population change. Are there any other areas that you can think of that have been kind of immune to the rapid growth in population and demands on the environment?

Interviewee: Immune? No. So you know the Endowment Lands, and there's also Stanley Park. So Stanley Park has become more gentrified, meaning it was kind of a natural forest [inaudible 00:04:59] with some trails and a perimeter sea wall. But more people and more people inclined to use the natural space, which is a wonderful aspect of Vancouver because there's so much park land for the people and open space along the waterfront, which was quite a bit different than in the United States where a lot of that area's privatized and the general populous just can't use it. But Vancouver is incredible in that way. But a lot of these places have been gentrified. Trails have been widened, there's wastepaper baskets, there's kiosks, there's ability to drive in with cars, and parking lots with parking meters, and different types of setups for explaining the forest and that type of thing. All wonderful stuff, but it has taken away from just the natural setting and beauty. That's progress I guess, to open things up to more people and make it more accessible to more people. But when I grew up it wasn't that accessible, so it was almost like a mini park for myself and other people in the local area just to bike ride in, or run in, or hike in, or goof around in as a kid and build forts. But you can't do that anymore.

Interviewer: Yeah. Definitely.

Interviewee: It's more policed now. On the other side, on that pollution side, which, over time, you could see where it's...we used to have different types of natural birds in our place. I don't know what types, but different colors of feathers, birds, and what have you. So there were parakeets and small...I don't know if they're parrots...they had to be yellow parakeets or something, but they eventually ceased. They died off from a few reasons. One was more pollution. So that affected their natural environment and probably the eco-chain of [inaudible 00:07:12] and those types of things but also starlings, which is a very aggressive long beak bird came in and started...I don't know how they came in, but they're coincidentally a southeast Asian bird I believe. They have a [inaudible 00:07:28]. They were brought in somehow and they started eating the robins' eggs and eating these different smaller birds' eggs and stuff. And it wiped them out.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: So that's kind of an infusion of a non-indigenous species having an effect on the indigenous species that were more fragile and also the effect of pollution on some of those fragile species.

Interviewer: Yeah. That totally makes sense and actually fits really well with kind of the project we're working on. But yeah. You've...

Interviewee: So here's another twist on that. So over time the densities rose, and that's something you can pick up when you've been to Vancouver and you see all these towers and what have you, condo towers and a lot of shopping areas that are mixed-use with living areas above them. It wasn't always like that. It used to be just an enclave in the West end of Vancouver, so downtown Vancouver, where a lot of department buildings were. And at one period of time that was the most densely populated area in the world, in the world. It was a very, very small area, downtown Vancouver. And again, progress over time, more people coming in discovered the beauty of it etc. That density there increased immensely and then spilled over into a lot of these bedroom communities to where now you have super high density, and with that has come a huge increase in environmental crimes and heavy crime and stuff because people are just on top of each other literally.

Okay. So here's one more component.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: So the infrastructure would never have kept pace with the expansion of the population, so the roads, the bridges. Money was spent on mass transit, so buses and light rail, not subways because there really isn't much underground, but it's above ground light rail, it's called light rapid transit, LRT. The money was spent there, which is great and people utilized that and it's efficient. But to move around on a road or trying to get out of the city, one has to plan around the day and movement just in order to save some time and not eat up a bunch of time just trying to get out of the city or within the city and around the city, apart from using sort of the rapid transit systems that are in place. And those now...I'm talking to my brother and friends out there, they say they're terrible. They have to...in the mornings, you know, three or four buses in the [inaudible 00:10:51] before they get on and squeeze a little [inaudible 00:10:54] light rail transit system. So it's not kept up. That has not even kept up to the increase in population and definitely, the road infrastructure hasn't. And I touched on earlier the pollution abatement, raw sewage, and those types of infrastructure needs haven't been keeping up either. Nor has the water source, sources. So in the summer when things get dry they have to water ration yet there's so much water available from lakes and the mountains. They just haven't developed the infrastructure to move the water down to the population base.

Interviewer: You've actually in all of your answers have pretty much covered everything that I was looking for. So yeah. Thank you for your time and I'll send you a copy of the interview when it's all pieced together.
