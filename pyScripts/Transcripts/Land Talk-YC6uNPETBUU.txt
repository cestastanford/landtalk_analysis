Interviewer: Are you ready?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: How would you describe the way the place used to look?

Interviewee: Referring to Paulding County where I grew up?

Interviewer: Yup.

Interviewee: Well, it's a farmland community, used to be a swamp called the Black Swamp. It was drained a long time ago into ditches, so it's extremely flat and it's mostly all farmland, mostly agricultural. And so, you have small groups of woods, but a lot of farmland, very small town and sparse population. And a long time ago when I was probably a child, there would be vegetation like trees in between acres of land which no longer exist, people chopped them down to have more farmland to do mega farming. But a long time ago, there were trees that lined the perimeter of the acres and also ditches too, and that helped the soil erosion and cutting down on wind and lack of....you know, taking the top soil off.

Interviewer: How would you say the place has changed?

Interviewee: I think there's only have been minor changes because the population maintains, it doesn't really grow. In fact, it actually decreases over time because there's little industry. So, it's still mostly farmland. I would say, there's, I'm guessing, fewer trees which don't have acreage surrounded big trees. You also have the addition of CAFOs or Confined Animal Feeding Operations that are really prevalent in that county, which didn't used to be there when we were kids, so that's a difference. And you also have windmills in the western part of the county, lots of them and that was never there before either. So, visually, that's how the landscape has changed.

Interviewer: What are some things you used to do when you were a child?

Interviewee: Well, the climate has changed, it's a lot warmer now. When I was a child, in the winter, it was very cold and stayed cold. This is Northwest Ohio, just below the lake-effect, off of Lake Erie. So, it's about an hour and a half south of Toledo. So, the activities in the winter, people used to ice skate a lot and sledding, and those winter activities, and then the normal summer activities. When I was a kid, mostly just playing outside. I lived in town and my dad had farm though, so I'd be out there some too, but it was creative play and we didn't really go hardly anywhere, do much, so our entertainment was what we made ourselves with other friends.

Interviewer: Good.
