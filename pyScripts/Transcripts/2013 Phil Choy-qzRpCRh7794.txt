[00:01]
Connie Young Yu: Phil?

[00:01]
Philip Choy: Okay. My name is Philip P. Choy and I am a native-born San Franciscan, third-generation.

[00:13]
Yu: And we'd like you to talk about how you were involved—

[00:17]
Choy: You're gonna speak a little louder too.

[00:19]
Yu: —how you were involved with the 100th anniversary of the Golden Spike Celebration?

[00:25]
Choy: I was involved with the Golden Spike or the 100th, uh, Centennial Golden Spike, uh, Celebration because I was the president of the Chinese Historical Society, and it was a great opportunity. After 100 years, we finally got a chance to put the Chinese on the map. 

[00:51]
Yu: Well, first of all, how did the Chinese Historical Society of America—under your leadership, how did they plan to celebrate the Centennial? What did they want to do? 

[01:02]
Choy: Well, actually, we have been waiting for this golden moment. And actually, as I said, most people never knew about the role the Chinese played in the Transcontinental. So we planned on putting a plaque at Sacramento as the initiation of the railroad and then at the terminus, at Promontory Point, a plaque that would commemorate the heroic feats the Chinese made. 

[01:42]
So we petitioned the Chinese Six Companies at that time which still represented the voice of the Chinese of the America. We petitioned them for funds to have these plaques made. So it was successful. And at that time, it only cost us 500 dollars. Can you imagine that? A bronze—

[02:11]
Okay. The two plaques were made. Each cost us 500 dollars a piece. It was successful when we dedicated at the, uh, Sacramento, at the celebration there, and subsequently took the plaque to Utah, Promontory Point, and were ready to dedicate the second plaque. However, I would have to say that I was rather naive at the time because we wrote letters prior to this, in preparation, asking permission and telling them what we wanted to do. And we wanted to be on the main program, and we expressed that. However, with all the communication and letters coming back, it kind of convinced us that, "Yes, we recognize the role that Chinese played and we will certainly, uh, accommodate the situation." So like I said, as naive as I was, I thought, Oh, we got our spot on the main program. And I asked for only a few minutes because we know there will be a keynote speaker. But we just ask a few minutes and wasn't going to take a lot of time. 

[03:39]
But even though with all this positive interchange, when we arrived, we were, of course, escorted to the platform. And when I say, "When we arrived," Thomas Chin, the executive director and myself were the representatives of the Chinese community. So we sat there patiently and thought that we would have a chance to speak, but I didn't see the plaque there. So I was thinking that something was wrong. And sure enough, by the time, the program over, we recognized that we were not a part of the main program and that then some person came up to me and said, "We will now dedicate your plaque." And I looked at him quizzically, you know, "Where at?," so he said, "Just follow me," and took us to the auditorium which something seated, I believe, about 200 people. And by that time, my hair is standing up. I was so irate, especially when Volpe said, "Who else but Americans?," you know? Everything was, "Who else but Americans can do this and do that?" 

[05:14]
And even when he mentioned other nationalities, like the Germans, the British, the Irish, and so on, not a single word in the whole keynote speech was mentioning a single word of the Chinese. So by that time, I was just—I mean, I almost grabbed the microphone, but I was pulled off. So, maybe lucky it did, because I would have been cussing and screaming and yelling.

[05:51] 
But anyway, we went to the auditorium, and by that time— Let's see. The Consul General—I don't recall his name, but Consul General was representing the Taiwan government, not the People's Republic of China today. He was invited and the only other two persons that were there was actually your father and your mother [referring to Connie Young Yu], and that's Col. John Young and his wife Mary Young. So they were the only witness, besides Tom Chin and the Consul General, who witnessed what I said.

[06:36]
And then unfortunately, they are not there anymore. I will try to be—let's say, not embellish what I said. I remember very distinctly, "100 years ago, we slighted the Chinese. And now, 100 years later, when we have the chance to make that correction, we fail to do that." 

[07:05]
And I said very clearly—I said to the Chairman, whose name was Goodfellow, some Thomas Goodfellow. I said to him, you know, "You people of high places can't see what's going on today below you." And what I was referring to right at the—you know, if you remember 1969, after all the strikes and the riots like Los — the burning of Watts and so on, "See, you can't see what's happening and this is why the nation is in such a condition and slighting the Chinese." So I also—Well, he stood up after that. He offered to apologize, to shake my hand. And I said, "No, you don't shake my hand, I am only one person. You go back out there and apologize to the whole nation." And of course, even before that, the Governor of Utah and the Senator of Utah made their apology and so on. But it was Goodfellow who offered to shake my hand and apologize. That really made me mad. I just said, "Don't apologize to me," you know, "Go outside and apologize to the whole nation.: But that's sort of the short story of what—

[08:47]
Yu: I do remember my parents came back from the trip, saying, "Phil was so angry." And what he said was just so vivid and so right on. Could you talk about the Promontory Point Ceremony of May 10, 1969 and describe Senator John Volpe and who he was? 

[09:10]
Choy: Well, Volpe was the keynote speaker of the centennial. And he was the Secretary of Transportation. And obviously he didn't do his homework. Well, like all politicians, somebody else would write the speech for him. So, he became the scapegoat, you might say. And of course, the community, after the incident, community asked for his apology and even asked for President Nixon's apology. To me, it's all water under the bridge, it's all over, it's done. Our mission—we failed our mission to put the Chinese back on the map. And so, I didn't participate in any of the news conferences thereafter and demanding an apology. I just kind of gave up and felt that I had failed the mission. 

[10:19]
Yu: Well actually you succeeded, because the publicity nationwide of Volpe's huge mistake was—you know, everybody heard about it. It got more publicity for the Chinese, because what Volpe said was, "Who else but Americans could drill ten tunnels in the mountains, thirty feet deep in the snow? And who else but Chinese could lay ten miles of track in one day? And who else but the Chinese could, you know, blast through the Sierras?" So it was very specific. These were tasks the Chinese did. So the fact that he never—didn't know that American Chinese couldn't be citizens—and so—

[11:01]
Choy: Well, I guess you are right in that sense. In retrospect, actually, it did more to single out the fact thereafter. I mean, today, everybody knows. If they don't know much about Chinese American history, they at least know that the Chinese were involved in, well, a major, major task. We don't recognize, uh, uh, how enormous that task was, and the significance of that task. And furthermore, we talk about building the railroad and how it connect the east and west and then caused the—promoted the expansion of the west. That's one thing.

[11:49]
But we fail to recognize, we really fail to recognize that one of the impetus of the building of the railroad was to establish a port on the Pacific coast and have communication, transpacific communication, with China, to trade with China. That was one of the major impetus that we have failed to recognize today. 

[12:23]
Yu: Back to the ceremony on May 10th, were there—uh, was it outdoors and was there a large crowd? Could you describe what it was like?

[12:32]
Choy: Actually at the reenactment of the Centennial, the (unintelligible) were out there as it was originally. There were about 20,000, I believe, of people in attendance. There must have been that many. And, well, it was mainly a political stunt. I mean, it wasn't very serious. And in fact, the reenactment of the driving of the spike of course was taking place. That was when our ceremony, our dedication of the plaque to the Chinese, had simultaneously taken place. Again, it kinda shows that we were not a major part of the ceremony, but sort of a sideline or side board. 

[13:40]
Yu: So, uh, where is the plaque now? What happened to the plaque? 

[13:45]
Choy: The plaque is now placed in, uh, Promontory Point with a number of plaques I see. As I recall, oh, some railroad engineering society plaque was right alongside that and a number of other plaques all placed outside. But it isn't like it should be. It should be singled out, standing out by itself. It wasn't an adjunct of the railroad building, but it actually was a major, major feat.

[14:29]
Yu: Was there any photographic display involving the Chinese? Was there anything that acknowledged the Chinese that people could walk by and see? 

[14:38]
Choy: Well I haven't been back to Promontory Point. Only a second time. And that was maybe ten, fifteen years ago. And I would say that the Chinese aren't—I didn't notice anything very prominent about the Chinese role. There may be, but it escaped my eyes at that time. 

[15:11]
Yu: Well, the article that caused the big stir and, you know, brought the attention, uh, to the public about the Chinese and your role was in the Chronicle May 12th, 1969. And it was reported by Dale Champion who must have been there. The title was The Forgotten Men of the Golden Spike and he described sitting in angry silence at the rear of the bunting of the platform, "where Phil Choy, chairman of the Chinese Historical Society, and his colleague Thomas Chin, founder and director of the Society—" It mainly focused on your reaction, so I think that was very important. 

[16:01]
Choy: Well I think that the reaction is somewhat underplayed because I was short of cussing at those people, but I wasn't very—I was beside myself. I would say that, uh, people know me, I'm out of character. 

[16:31]
Barre Fong: How hard was it to raise that money for the thousand dollars for the two plaques? Was that difficult?

[16:38]
Choy: The raising the money was not difficult, because it came from the Chinese Six Companies, which was supposed to be representing the community anyway. So everybody sort of contributed. And again the—I thought at that time that even the six people at the Six Companies recognize, or even knew of the Transcontinental Railroad. So it was something that really—Well the timing was right to bring this up because this was the Civil Rights riots taking place right at that time. So it fitted right into the whole picture, and yet, the politicians didn't see that. They were totally naive in that sense.

[17:38]
Yu: They couldn't make the connection. But incredible that the men who built the impossible railroad were not recognized after the Chinese historic centennial to pay a tribute to them. So, you know, certain members of the community knew that, you know, this was an opportunity and it did take a lot of dedication you said went well.

[17:57]
Fong: Sorry. 

[18:04]
Yeah. 

[18:06]
Yu: (unintelligible) I was getting some of the details.

[18:07]
Fong: Yeah.

[18:13]
Choy: Let me— Oh, the—

[18:17]
Man: Yeah, hang on. Give me a second here. (unintelligible) here.

[18:27]
Yu: So hang onto that thought.

[18:28]
Fong: Yeah, hold the thought.

[18:30]
Yu: Hold the thought. We want you to say it.

[18:43]
Looks good.

[18:43]
Fong: Okay, go ahead.

[18:44]
Yu: All right, Phil.

[18:45]
Choy: Um-hm. On the Sacramento incident, actually, the Chinese Historical Society was asked to review some of the preliminary plans. And I remember the architect of the Railroad Museum, at that early period, showed us the plan of the museum, what they planned to do. I forget the name of the architect. And I wish we had saved the plans because the initial sketches of the museum was the entryway that showed Promontory Point, with the Big Four all carved out onto the mountains, just like Mt. Rushmore, replicating that. And I said, "Wow, we come in here." And way below them, a few figures of Chinese workers and I commented on that. I said, "Where—where are the Chinese?," you know? "You made them almost invisible." I said, "You should take the Big Four out of there and put the four Chinese up on the mountain." And I guess it wasn't taken—my comments weren't taken very well. 

[20:32]
The whole point is that, it was still celebrating the Big Four. They had a big part in it. There is nothing to say to deny that. But the whole point is, who were responsible of doing all that dirty work, you know? And yet they continue to underplay the role, and the presence of the Chinese. And that—you know, it's not just the relating, you know, the building of the Transcontinental Railroad and all that. It's not just relating to American history. It's related to all the—in the course of building American history, there were other people involved, the millions and millions of people involved in the building of the nations, and all we can see is the names of politicians and so on. And that's where our problems were in the Civil Rights period, in the negligence of the minorities who were participants and victims of American history.

[21:59]
Yu: And then the ceremony where the Chinese were forgotten, you know, became sort of emblematic, you know, of this problem and also an opportunity. 

[22:10]
Choy: Absolutely, they blew it. Um-hm.

[22:17]
Fong: So, um, if I could—I know we wanted to talk about the ceremony. But so you're a third generation Californian? Sorry, I'm just getting—Or San Franciscan? Or where did—

[22:29]
Choy: San Franciscan, yeah.

[22:30]
Fong: So could—would you just trace back through what you, uh, know of your earliest ancestors, in two minutes?


Choy: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'm third-generation San Franciscan on my grandfather and grandmother's side. Both my grandfather and grandmother was here in San Francisco, uh, in the eighteen—I am not sure whether it was before the Exclusion Act, or after. I suspect it's before the Exclusion Act, they were already here. 

[23:11]
Yu: Do you know what kind of work your—uh, they did? What kind of, uh, work did your ancestors do when they came to America? 

[23:20]
Choy: Actually, my grandfather was a houseboy in Oroville to a doctor. Subsequently, then he continued to work in different merchandise stores. Then by 1913, he opened a butcher market—a western style butcher market—in Sacramento. 

[23:50]
Yu: Well, you're an architect, but we know you as a historian, a prominent historian of the Chinese America. So, briefly, how did this come about? I mean, when you were working as an architect, your interest in Chinese history? 

[24:08]
Choy: Well actually I've always been interested, actually, in the history of the West. Like every young kid, I watched, what was called at that time, cowboy movies, you know? And even before John Wayne, there was Tom Nixon, Hoot Gibson, Ken Baynor(??), names that you probably never heard of. But—you know, Buck Jones and all that. So that's way before the John Wayne era. So I was, you know, enamored with the West just like everybody else was. And I used to go, when I had time—at an older age anyway, I used to visit all these places where events took place and followed the Western Trail and so on. But in doing so, I saw a lot of Chinese artifacts, like every little bottle you see was labeled "opium bottles." That kind of thing. Every pipe, Chinese pipe, you see in the museums, they're labeled "opium pipes." I said, "They don't look like that. It can't be." And that sort of piqued my interest. And I started to take more interest in it, and I actually, you know, did a little bit of reading, a lot more reading. But the reading—I see you never find much about the Chinese, except very negative things. 

[26:03]
So that's kind of how I got started, in Chinese American history, by doing a lot of research myself. And when I heard the Historical Society was founded, I said, "Oh, I am going to learn more." So I joined the Historical Society and then subsequently became, you know, President, and at that time was right when the Centennial was going to take place. And I said, "Aha, here we go. We have this chance to put the Chinese on the map." 

[26:45]
Yu: And, um, I wanted to ask about your archaeology work. You actually have worked on railroad sites where the Chinese were and you found—

[26:56]
Choy: No. I actually have not worked on, uh, sites, or excavation sites on railroad camps. It's just that I got involved or interested in researching in the subject, mainly because archaeologists have asked me to identify certain items and so on. And as I read reports of, uh, archaeologists on the work, some of it doesn't seem to be quite right, anyway. And so I decided whenever I had a chance, when I ever visited China, I would kind of start asking and try to see if I can find a little bit more information. 

[27:53]
Originally, when people asked me about the items, I said, "Well, what's so exciting about it?," because these were items we use daily, in our own lives, when we were growing up. So I said, "What's so unusual?" And for archaeologists at that time, it was, uh, exciting, because they never recognized that the Chinese were all over California. And just like you talk about San Jose—they didn't know there was a Chinatown in San Jose. But we grew up knowing there was until redevelop came and wiped all the Chinatowns out. And so even the newer immigrants who came didn't recognize—let's say, in the Silicon Valley area and so on—when they began to discover Chinese artifacts and so on. Most of the newcomers don't recognize that Chinese been here during the Gold Rush period. And that's actually part of the building of California. So we have been reduced to a bunch of foreigners. And even to this day, we are considered foreigners. And knowing history helps us recognize that the Chinese were actually a part of California's beginnings. 

[29:36]
Yu: And you're continually writing about the Chinese in California.

[29:40]
Choy: What's that?

[29:43]
Yu: You're continually writing (both talking at once)

[29:44]
Choy: Oh no, I'm slowing down a bit. It's a little bit—it's still quite, quite interesting, every facet of it. It's just there are a lot of other people has to carry on and so on, writing.

[30:05]
Yu: But you did a very recent presentation. You did a recent presentation in San Francisco of the Chinese.

[30:12]
Choy: Oh, this was on the 150th year of the Embarcadero. And again, you know, we talk about the Embarcadero. And then here again, in the celebration, we talk very little of the presence of the Chinese, okay. We talk about labor and all that, which is valid and so in. But the beginning of the bay, the port itself, had to do with the relationship between China and the United States. People don't recognize the fact that the reason why the nation was interested in the Pacific coast was to establish a port to trade with China. And not only that, the goods that were found, the items for trade, was the sea otter, the major item, the furs of the sea otter. And so Boston merchants were sailing along the Pacific to gather the fur and then trade with China. And that's how the ports along the California coast developed and the interest in the port. And San Francisco once was, you know, profusely full of sea otters, right in the bay here, and ships were coming in to the port to gather the fur, and then go across the Pacific and trade with China. So this is not known as we celebrate the 150th year of the Embarcadero. 

[32:24]
Yu: Another anniversary for teaching, teaching about the Chinese railroad. Yeah?

[32:30]
Fong: Yeah, uh, one more question. You can take a drink of water. Um, so you mentioned the, um, beginnings of the CHSA during the Civil Rights Movement. And I am kind of wondering how old you were around that time and what it was like for you as a Chinese American, in San Francisco? What were—

[32:53]
My own story was, I remember my grandfather telling us that he tried to buy a home in the Richmond district, you know, with—all were leaving Chinatown. He tried to buy a home. I think it was '62 or '61, and the people would just take the signs down when he showed up at the door, "Oh no, it's sold already." So I'm kind of wondering what your—you know, in the '60s—what your life was like.

[33:14]
Choy: Well, I think, in the '60s, of course, you know, we were just beginning to feel the benefits of the Civil Rights, except for one thing. I mean, housing was still a basic problem. Uh, I mean, I would not be able to buy the house right here on Russian hill. 

[33:39]
Uh, I remember when Sarah and I got married and looking for a place around outside of the Chinatown area to find a place to live. You know, we're up and near Nob Hill. "Here's a place for rent." We walk in there, and the management says, "Oh, I'm sorry," you know, "We just rented it." "Okay," we walked away and so on. Next day, we come back, the sign is back again already. 

[34:20]
My favorite phrase was that after World War II, that—or during World War II, everything for the Chinese improved because of the manpower shortage. We actually were able to find employment in every industry and so on. In fact, one of my very first jobs, in high school, I was working in the waterfront as a longshoreman. I was paid even more, making more money than my father was making. And so things were improving, and so it looked very positive that, gee, things have finally turned and changed.

[35:13]
But after the war, when you start to move in and try to—there's still the real estate governance that said, you know, "No color. We are not going to—" So people of our generation and generation before that and so on still were facing that discrimination until Truman passed the Civil Rights Act that you can't discriminate and so on, and there was penalties for it. 

[35:47]
And, well, North Beach was unusual in the sense it was different. North Beach, because the Chinese were able to move in, we have forgotten that the Italians in North Beach were also immigrants and they, after the war, were able to achieve the upward mobility. They also were looking for the American Dream. And they were also looking for the car and the garage and the backyard gardens and so on and the single home. So they moved, they were able to move to Millbrae. I think that's where a lot of them moved in. So who's gonna buy the homes? Right next to Chinatown the Chinese were able to move in and were able to buy the homes. 

[36:51]
Now, the Italians, of course, were able to buy homes at that time, oh, for, say, to 10,000 dollars. They could sell their homes to the Chinese for 24,000 or 25,000, two units. Actually, the average price, about 24,000. So these were flats and units they bought when there was maybe about 4,000 or 5,000. Of course, you look back on it, I think the Chinese made out because these buildings are millions of dollars now. (laughter) So we got the last laugh anyways. 

[37:42]
Yu: I think that's good. You know, I think that we covered the railroad part. You know, we can always go back to that history but that's for another time.

[37:52]
Fong: Anything else you have, uh, on your mind about the railroad, about, uh—

[37:58]
Yu: Anything about the building? Have you been to Cape Horn? Did you make any pilgrimages just along the north?

[38:07]
Choy: No, I haven't been back for quite some time, in terms of seeing what's developed. 

[38:15]
Yu: But the railroad was fascinating to you. Right? The railroad was very important and fascinating to you.

[38:21]
Choy: Again, the railroad was the pivotal point in making the Chinese known in participation of American history. So yes, I think that at that moment—unfortunately, I felt that I failed my charge, so to speak. But, that was the grand—you know, the great moment to take advantage of it.

[39:02]
Fong: So we are coming up on 150 years soon, so maybe there's another moment for the CHSA to shine.

[39:10]
Choy: Well, they better not make that mistake again. I don't think—it would be impossible to make that mistake. 

[39:19]
Yu: But you can bring out the points. You can do, uh, another presentation. 

[39:25]
Choy: 150th? I ain't gonna be around. (Laughter) 

[39:30]
Yu: Well, and certainly, for the hiring of the Chinese—that's next year, 2015.

[39:36]
Fong: And now we have Stanford alongside. That will help a lot, I think.

[39:41]
Yu: And Stanford has to make up for another thing, for the 100th anniversary of the railroad. The whole celebration was about the golden spike and Leland Stanford. Not one mention about the Chinese and the fact that his fortune was made on the backs of Chinese workers.

[40:03]
Oh, I do have a question. Do you know about the history of the Chinese working at Stanford on the farm?

[40:12]
Choy: Uh, no, I don't know much about the farm workers but obviously, the Stanford—on one hand, while he was mouthing anti-Chinese rhetoric and so on, he was hiring all the Chinese on the farm.

[40:31]
Yu: And for certainty(??).

[40:33]
Choy: And, you know, at the mansion, when he was governor, he had Chinese servants and cooks and everything else. So it's some of the unknown, uh, parts of history.

[40:57]
Yu: Is there anything—

[40:58]
Fong: Yep.

[40:59]
Yu: I think we got—

[40:59]
Choy: —important part of the program. Um-hm.

[41:05]
Yu: The Chinese—they didn't think of the Chinese as being any part of society to—you know, that they didn't care about offending people

[41:13]
Fong: I think what's happening in the—
