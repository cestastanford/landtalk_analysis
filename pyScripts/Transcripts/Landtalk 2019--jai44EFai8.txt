Man: So, it was an open field. All the way from the street back down to the creek. And it had very tall grass, probably three-foot tall. And there was an old gate that divided the upper section from the lower section. So, we had to decide. One of our big decisions was which way to put the front door because we're down in the middle of a lot. So it could have gone either out towards the street, which is how most houses are, but we decided to face it to the south because that's where the sun is mostly. And so, that's what we did. So we had to kind of figure out where to place the house on the lot. The other big question was whether to put the house up close to the street, like most of the other houses in the neighborhood, or put it down here in the middle of the lot. And we chose the middle of the lot. Just to give us a little more quiet and more room to ourselves. We've been here 15 years, then?

Woman: Almost 17.

Man: Almost 17. So, 17 years. The land changed a lot just because we've lived here. So, suddenly, you know, all that tall grass we tried to keep mowed down, so that's definitely different. The neighbors to our north have changed over the years. For a while there, they were elderly and couldn't mow their yard. So we did have very tall grass to the north for a while. And since then, we've had new neighbors and they have cut all their grass back down. So, that's changed the look of it for sure. Everybody else around us, I think was here with the exception of a house further down the street. And, you know, it's pretty much been the same. We kind of had to tier [SP] the land a little bit to get a flat spot for our house, before the ground basically went downhill all the way from the street to the creek. And we cut a little flat section in it for our house. So, we started out with a fairly smaller house, for the size of our family, I guess I should say. Chose not to put a basement in. And we had three bedrooms and an attic space, right?

Woman: Yeah.

Man: Right. So, that's how we started. And then, so the addition added a family room. A bigger extension to the boys' room and then another bedroom for the girls, for [inaudible 00:03:27].

Woman: More deck.

Man: More what?

Woman: Deck, outside.

Man: More deck. A little deck, right. Guess as the kids got older, they would have more friends over for fires.

Woman: Garden lawn. 

Man: What's that?

Woman: Garden lawn.

Man: Yeah. Right. [inaudible 00:03:46] started the garden pretty much, or wanted a garden. So yeah, good one. Yeah, had a garden the last few years. Year or two ago, we started doing compost. Trying not to put any food waste into the rivers. Let's see, the swings are still there, but like very rarely used. But think we'll probably just leave it for the next generation. Won't be long.
