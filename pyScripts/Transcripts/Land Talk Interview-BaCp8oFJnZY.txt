Interviewer: So, Mom, how did the Lafayette Forest look when you were a kid? 

Mom: There was lots of open space, kind of tall grasses. Some trees but mainly more like plains with lots of dry tall grasses. Our house sat on 2 acres. My best friend's house sat on 2 acres. That wasn't so uncommon. 

Interviewer: Okay. And, how would you say this area and Lafayette has changed?

Mom: It's changed fairly dramatically over the years. As I said, there was lots of open space to play, to do kinds of things kids do. And, in my neighborhood alone, for example, I would say since I was a child, there's easily about 50 more houses that have been built in that area. And, in the surrounding areas, again, where there was a lot of open space there are now housing developments. So, it's harder to find large areas that haven't been developed of land.

Interviewer: So, what are some things that you used to do here?

Mom: When I was young?
 
Interviewer: When you were younger.

Mom: My best friend had a horse named Joe and which she actually kept in her own yard because it was so big. And, we would get on Joe, and walk down the street, and get to the end of the road. And, as I said, there were hills, and grass, and trails, and so we would ride Joe all over the place. And, we were maybe 10 minutes from her house, you know, but we'd ride up on the hills, we'd do jumps. When we really young, about 11 or 12, we'd pretend we were like pioneers exploring a new area.

Interviewer: Were there any like creeks or any places like that that you used to go to, or was it mostly just grassland?

Mom: Mostly grassland. My friend had a creek on her property and so sometimes we'd...there was a tire swing and we'd swing with that. But, there weren't any creeks that I recall, you know.

Interviewer: Okay. And, what are some of the things that you do in Lafayette now, now that it's developed?

Mom: Well, it would be really hard to go horseback riding now. I don't, I think one would end up trespassing on someone's property. I think the things that...outside things now it's more like going to a park, a particular park, where there'll be a lot of space or, you know, there might be an outside barbecue or activity but it's at someone's home. You stay on someone's property. That's how it's different, I think, now.

Interviewer: Okay. Well, thank you for your time.

Mom: You're welcome.
