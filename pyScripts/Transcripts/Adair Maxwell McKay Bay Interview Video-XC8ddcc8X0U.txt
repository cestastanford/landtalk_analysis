Adair: My name is Adair Maxwell, I'm a sophomore studying Science, Technology and Society, and I interviewed my father, John Maxwell, about his experiences with McKay Bay, which is part of Tampa Bay, Florida. How did this place look before, and how do you think it's changed?

John: A good number of years ago, 15, 20 years, I always kind of enjoyed the calmer atmosphere, and you could fish and you could get oysters and quite a number of things. It was very easy to do. McKay Bay was one such place, but there were a number of them. And what happened over the years, aside from a couple of hurricanes back in the '80s, was the industrialization. It's a big shipping port and there's a few phosphorus companies and nitrogen would get in the water and make it inhospitable to oysters.

Adair: What are some of the things you used to do here, and how is it compared to the things you do here now?

John: And so what we've done is create barriers out of old seashells that enable the oysters to grab on and grow. All right, these are the bags volunteers, and they take two boats out, loaded as you can see, and they will drop it into the bay where it forms a stag. Now, what it looks like underwater, I don't know if you can see that well, these little jewels at the bottom. Across the water there, where there's a bank they're building up. So, it used to be, once upon a time in the '60s, they did a lot of dredging and that just wiped out a lot of the colonies. They finally figured out that doing that was causing a problem and so they've kind of moved away from that. So now we've got replenishing the supplies of habitat. They're dumping the bags over to have...it's a shoreline or sorts. It's more of a mangrove type thing. They're building it up because the oysters will pop up.
