Interviewee: When we first came here, my grandma opened up a so-called…just like today's 7-Eleven, which is service station plus… She'd buy candy. You know how a 7-Eleven goes.

Dorian: Yeah.

Interviewee: And she raised three daughters and my dad, go running that service station, which is old, old-fashioned. You gotta know your electricity. You gotta pump gas in a glass. I don't know if you've seen those things. So it's one of those that's so simple, but that's what my grandma did, and raised three daughters and my dad. 

And one of the big change in…education-wise was the first and second generation is supposed to go… You're supposed to go to sixth grade and you were supposed to go work because everybody's so poor. Plantation days, you go… Plantation days, okay? So my dad went to high school, which is rare to go high school in the 1920s, early…late 1920s. He went further than that. He went four years of chemistry…that is chemistry degree, and he did… I think he did the impossible. He played football, made the varsity team, he played baseball, made the varsity team, and graduated with Lieutenant into the ROTC program. Then he went to work. 

So right across our house is Aiea High School, the church, and so forth. It was all 100% cane field. No high school, no fire station, no nothing. No church, no nothing. All sugar plantation. Then, in about 19…at least 1950, sugar was going out already. Sugar was too expensive to run. They cannot compete with Cuba in producing sugar. So the biggest change for me was to see all the sugarcane field gone. And of course the stadium came, the fire station came, but these are all very major changes for us. The church, church is another one, right across our house. So those are the biggest change for me. It is the economic change really, sugar industry to zero. 

We went to tourism. We went to tourism. That's the biggest change, yeah.

Dorian: Yeah. [inaudible 00:03:14]

Interviewee: Well, Hawaii gained statehood with…in 1959, 1959 August. August 19, I think. Yeah. We became the 50th state. And with that, military was really booming because Hickam Air Force Base, Kaneohe base, Schofield, I don't know, Marine base, Pearl Harbor… Hawaii became…we were best described as a stationary aircraft carrier. And the reason for that is that we had all the airplane over here, on the ground. It can take off like an aircraft carrier. We got all the fuel over here. We got all the food with the housing. So it was just like a huge, valuable aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 

As a result, we had changed from, I would say, sugarcane, pineapple to tourism and was overtaken by military investment here in Hawaii, mainly because of our geographic location, 2500 miles to California, and I don't know how far—I think about the same distance—to Guam. But anyway, we are here right in the center, and it's so valuable. So you can say that from sugar plantation days, we have convert…big, big change, to tourism. 

Then the biggest change was military outgrew sugar. And we couldn't compete with Cuba for sugar profit, pineapple with the Philippines. Compare our…the sugar harvesting guy working in the Philippines with Cuba. They're probably getting a dollar an hour, a dollar a day maybe, you know. Why are you gonna be giving me the four dollar, five dollar, which is expensive those days? So we couldn't keep up economically. And that's how we basically really changed. 

And more so when Pearl Harbor came, December 7, 1941. The value of Hawaii would triple, more than triple, because Japan… You know, Japan had the army, a powerful army, took over Manchuria, Indonesia. They went into the Philippines. They took over Guam. Hawaii was a stepping-stone…

Dorian: To the…

Interviewee: …to the West Coast. And it was so valuable that we had to fight back and save Pearl Harbor, which they did, yeah, the Battle of Midway. They beat the Japanese armada at the Battle of Midway. And then more so our Hickam Air Force Base and Pearl Harbor was really built up, built up, built up. 

So basically, those are the changes I've seen in 60 years, simple pineapple days, sugar plantation days to tourism, all because of economic… And then the military, yeah, and the value of geographic location of Hawaii. Between America, and Japan, and Guam, Philippines, there's Hawaii. And then in Hawaii, also for refueling up in mid-air. Difficult from West Coast to…all the way to Guam, Philippines, Japan, nonstop. Nonstop because of they can refuel up in the air. So we got the Air National Guard on duty to meet them halfway up as a service station.

So anyway, I think you can say geographically, it's important. And economically, how everything changed in my 80 years, but your report is 50 years, deeply changed, I've seen, yeah.

Dorian: How did things that you did change, like, just activities or, like, lifestyle, I guess, then versus now? You used to…

Interviewee: Oh, work-wise. Work-wise…

Dorian: …be more involved with the military, and then…

Interviewee: Well, first of all, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, we were under martial law the second…first week or second week. President FDR or Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared martial law. He set a curfew at 8:00. No one can be out on the street. The soldier is given that okay to shoot and kill. You've got no rights to retaliate or anything. Martial law is very strict. Tremendous power, you know. You lose all rights. Zero. 

Then they locked up all Japanese-Americans—not all, majority of them—into what they call concentration camp, and that's from '41 all the way to '55 when the war ended. The biggest concern was we are Japanese-Americans, but Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. We are Japanese. You look like the enemy, too, but the title of Japanese-Americans. As a result, we had civil rights those days, but they were all hauled up into buses and trucks and so forth and sent to a camp surrounded by barbed wire and everything. The fire station came up, Aloha Stadium, all of them came up. With all that improvement, it pumped the [inaudible 00:10:02] way up. So geographically, yeah, we…the value of land right here is so high, it's unreal.

Dorian: So I think you answered like the first three, yeah, like what did it look like before… 

Interviewee: Economically. Economically, yeah.

Dorian: …how did it change. And then yeah, like you used to, I guess, do more military work, yeah? And sort of in the last question was, like, what you do now, right?

Interviewee: You know, you can put down one of the biggest change that I went through, and this is the truth, at the age 6, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And I was born in '35, so at the age 6… All Japanese Americans were considered suspect of being spies or giving signals to the Japanese brigade to fire right over our house with flashlight. That will go definitely to Pearl Harbor. Suspect. Okay? 

Now, we were Japanese-Americans. That's so critical. And when that happened, when that happened, after the war was over with… It was President Clinton, I think, had to write an apology to all Japanese-Americans that were locked up up to 1955 when the war ended, and $25,000 cash free to everyone that's still living in…after the war was over with. Many of them died. And there was a letter of apology and $25,000. And I know the exact amount. 

My cousin is about four years younger than me. He was a baby. He was a baby, right? He doesn't know anything, but he was locked up with the parents. You know…

Dorian: That's sad.

Interviewee: …what Forty Niners is, our restaurant, yeah? 

Dorian: Yeah, yeah. My favorite.

Interviewee: Right below there. You know, they were living right next to Pearl Harbor. They were all locked up. Americans were now being locked up. And that was a big mistake, I guess. FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, under martial law, fucked them up, yeah.

I would really stress, Dorian, economic changes in Hawaii. Yeah. There's usually other companies right outside [inaudible 00:12:48]. It's cheaper to can and raise pineapple juice and pineapple in the Philippines. Everything is in the Philippines. When I make arrangements to United…I mean, Hawaiian Airlines, I'm calling Manila. Yes. There's Hawaiian handling all reservations over there because of cheap labor. In America, it's…I think it's $15 an hour. I'm sure, Philippines, I don't know what it is. But 55 pesos to 1 dollar, give them 1 dollar, you know…

Dorian: I see.

Interviewee: This should be very interesting for you, the economic part, how Hawaii had to revert back to tourism and military, and all…every cultural thing is thrown out the window. Okay. 

Dorian: Okay.

Interviewee: I hope I can help you, but I don't know if that was enough…

Dorian: I think that was…

Interviewee: …stuff.

Dorian: …plenty.
