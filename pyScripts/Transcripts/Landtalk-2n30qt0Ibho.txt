Interviewer: So what area are you going to be talking to me about today? 

Interviewee: Today we gonna be talking about the city of Brentwood. 

Interviewer: Okay, and what did Brentwood used to look like? 

Interviewee: It was a small town. It was calmer and quiet. Less people that used to live in the area. The house, they used to look older. 

Interviewer: Okay, and how did Brentwood change in appearance over 20 years? 

Interviewee: Well, it has changed a lot. One of those changes that have been happening lately is a lot of people are remodeling their houses. There's more commute in the area, more traffic, more stores are opening. There's a lot of construction going on in the streets. 

Interviewer: Okay, so what are some activities that you used to do here at Brentwood?

Interviewee: One of those activities that I used to do was sometimes in the evenings I used to go out for a run, and take my daughters to the park. But now I don't do it as much in the evening because there's a lot of commute going on. There is a lot of people doing different activities late in the evening. 

Interviewer: What are some of those activities? 

Interviewee: One of those activities is like there's a softball team that has brought a lot of attention to this town. It has been making a lot of changes in the area because now there is a little bit more traffic in the area because of that game going on. But otherwise, you know, it's still a nice town to live in. 

Interviewer: Okay. What do you remember from when you first moved here to Brentwood? 

Interviewee: I remember that this place used to look more simple, and there wasn't as much construction going on as there is now, there were a lot of stores close by, there were less people in the area, it was a little quiet than what it is now. 

Interviewer: So from before the 20 years where there were just a little bit of people here and now more people moved in here, they've made more houses, more people are coming to the area, and there is a lot more to do here than there was before? 

Interviewee: Yes, there is more activities and more stuff that you could do in the area. 

Interviewer: Okay, and would you say that these changes have been good things?

Interviewee: Overall, yes I would say that they have been good changes and different things that I have to get used to that I wasn't used to before. 

Interviewer: And those things being what? 

Interviewee: Meaning more traffic, more commute because remember that this town used to be a small town and it was less people. Now it has grown in the community like they have been building more stuff, more stores around the area and more people have moved into this area. 

Interviewer: Okay, what's your favorite part about living here in Brentwood? 

Interviewee: I like that the community has grown, and there are more stores that sometimes used to take me a little bit longer to get by, now they are closer. There are more activities going on so you could engage in the area. You could just go out for a walk and you're not gonna be by yourself, you're gonna see more people. You could engage with them. There's a lot of diversity in the community now that wasn't there before. 

Interviewer: Okay. Well, besides all the reconstructions, do you think there's been any other changes made to this place? 

Interviewee: Yes. They have built more houses around the area. They've put more speed bumps in the street. There is also one of the changes that I do like that they have made is that they've made more sidewalks so that the people wouldn't be on the streets. Now they are able to walk on the sidewalks instead of being on the streets, on the traffic. That used to be my concern before, that it was dangerous. Because sometimes they're a lot of people that just drive by and... Like I was saying before, there's more traffic now than it used to be before. But the new houses that they have built, now they look bigger and the old ones a lot of people are making changes to them, they're remodeling too. So it has been a good change. 

Interviewer: Okay, well, thank you for your time. 

Interviewee: You are welcomed.
