Nicholas: So, my name is Nicholas Jenkins. And I'm gonna be talking about the Stanford area in Northern California, where I'm a member of the English department, so I teach poetry. I also teach an ITALIC which is a freshman arts program, which I enjoy very much. And I wasn't born here. I was born in England and so I have a, sort of, very different climate to compare this with. And, I think, I've been here about 18 years now.

Interviewer: Great. Awesome. So, what do you remember what this place looked like when you first arrived and the immediate impression that you had of the environment around you, kind of, this is historic appearance?

Nicholas: So, I was coming from the East Coast and so, California is a different country from the East Coast. And so, I was just struck by the nature, you know, plants, the trees, the abundance of trees here. I was struck by the sunlight, kind of very dry, sharp sunlight, where the shadows immediately offer you relief from heat. Whereas, you know, what I was used to was a muggy...mugginess that I couldn't really escape from, even when you went into the shadows. And so, I just remember the nature was a very important part of my first feeling about what California or Northern California is, just because it's so striking. And so, I was struck by that. I guess the other thing that I was struck by after living here for a few months, because we arrived here from the East Coast in September, I think, and I was first struck by how long the sunlight went on for. I was used to, you know, things getting very dark and cold and certainly, by the end of October. And the sunlight here just stayed switched on for a month, two months after I was used to. So, it felt, like, almost like going on a jet to a different country and the time was different. But in this case, it seemed like the month must be different because it wasn't corresponding to...

Interviewer: Great.

Nicholas: ...my experience at all. So, I remember all that very vividly. Lots of plants and shrubs that I'd never really seen before. Different kinds of birds. I noticed the birds a lot. So, it's just very exciting and beautiful. And then, around about January, the beginning of January, it started raining. In fact, the first rainy season that I went through here, the Stanford library flooded.

Interviewer: Oh, wow. 

Nicholas: The basement flooded because there was some, kind of, blockage in the drainage system and... But there's the underground level of the Stanford library, not far from where we're sitting now, was under about two or three feet of water. And the rain was different than I was used to as well. I mean, I grew up in England where it rains quite a lot, maybe not as much as people like to think it does, but it rains quite a lot or it did. I'm not sure whether it still does, but it rained during my childhood, kind of, lots of different sorts of rain. Sometimes, a kind of staccato rain, sometimes more like a just a, kind of, gentle mist, drizzles, sprinkles. The rain here was different in Northern California. It was like somebody was pouring up the rain out of a bucket. It just came down really hard and it was exhilarating. I thought it was wonderful. It felt slightly edgy, you know, more than the rain I was used to. I was used to snow from the East Coast and rain. But this really seemed different. The light changed in that January as I remember it. You know, it became very silver light because of the rain and the moisture that was in the atmosphere. And so, I was just taking all of that in. I guess you could say I was drinking it in, and it formed part of my really strong impression of what this climate was like. And, you know, when I would mention it to people who'd lived here for a while, they would all just nod and so, "What else is new?" They knew that this is what happened. And now, we're talking in February, and it feels like it's almost mid-summer.

Interviewer: I believe that.

Nicholas: And it feels very strange. So, I think, you know, water is history. Water is life and history. And water is the history of the West, particularly. And I just feel, like, you know, we have now entered a new phase. I deliberately didn't look at any of the data to back that up. I mean, everybody here, as you know, now talks about droughts. And we just came out of a drought, and now we're heading into another one. And so, I just feel like this is a new chapter in what Northern California is.

And, I think, you know, when I've ever mentioned the lack of rain to people, it's something that everybody's thinking about now in Northern California. I was in the Sierra Foothills of...a week or so ago, and, you know, you look at the tops of trees, and you'd look for dryness and deadness in the tops of the trees, which I don't think people used to do. I was having my teeth examined today by a dentist, and she lives on the coast in Pescadero, just on the other side of the hills here separating us from the Pacific, and she said, "Oh, yeah. Every morning, the mist used to roll in, the fog used to roll in, and it would clear by midday." But they don't have so much mist and fog anymore. So, I feel like, you know, the way that I register it, just in my own kind of personal, subjective, non-scientific way is that water has begun to play an increasingly prominent role in my imagination of the lack of water, a lack of rain. Everybody has a different way of measuring it.

You know, I've a friend who grew up in New Jersey. And as a girl, she used to go to these beautiful New Jersey beaches. And the way she remembers it is that when she was a girl, you could just put your hand down into the sand and pull it up, and there would be hundreds of shells, tiny shells of all kinds of different beautiful markings on them, you know, sort of, almost like treasure just scooped out of the sand. And she went back with her son recently and it was wanting him to be able to do the same thing. And when she just put her hand into the wet sand, ocean sand, and pulled out a scoop of it in her palm, there was just sand. So, everybody has a different personal calibration of climate change often connected, I think, with childhood. And for me anyway, rain is the kind of index of what's different.

Interviewer: Great. Okay. Very cool. I've yet to experience the rainy season of Northern California, but it's starting to seem like I won't because everyone's...

Nicholas: Well, I'm sure there'll be one, it'll come because, like, we all know that it isn't just a sort of...it doesn't follow a, kind of, steady path year by year. Like last year, we had a lot of rain and particularly snow. I'm not sure the snow and rain even correlate exactly, but there was a lot of snow in the Sierras last year. We came out of the drought, the reservoirs filled up, and it seemed like we'd turned the corner. And, maybe, in a way we had but then after another year, we turned the corner again, and now we're back to the way it was before. So, you know, I really hope, Izzy, that sometime during your four years of Stanford you get to experience a Northern California rainy season, but I'm not betting on that.

Interviewer: Great. Great.

Nicholas: It'd be great. It's a beautiful season. It's really wonderful and because...especially for people who come from, like, the East Coast or from Europe, where there are four seasons. There actually were two seasons at least in Northern California because there was the sunlight, and the dryness, and the, you know, real beauty that goes with that, but there was also the rainy season. And now, we, sort of, since...as we talked about just a moment ago, we're talking in February and it's like this. I just wonder whether we don't...if we only have one season, we don't have a season. And we don't have seasons anymore because there's no variation. So, yeah. It's a really momentous change and it could be disapproved by somebody showing me the figures. And I would feel like, "Okay." I would have to accept the reality that it wasn't a really as simple as that. But, you know, just for me, the absence of heavy rain is my way of understanding what climate change means to me.

Interviewer: Gotcha. Cool. Yeah. I really like the rain and I think... When I went home to New York for winter break, what you said about the lighting being different really struck me because that's exactly what I was thinking about when I went home, is that the sky is always so...you get only blue here.

Nicholas: Yeah, right.

Interviewer: And yeah...

Nicholas: No clouds.

Interviewer: Yeah. Cloud was...

Nicholas: Or few clouds. I mean, we do get great clouds too but yeah, it's true, when you often look up like you were looking up now through a kind of very carefully cultivated system of vines on the law school, Trellis, and we look up into the sky, and it's totally blue. There's nothing up there except the occasional plane.

Interviewer: Great. And then I went to New York for the winter and it was like the sky was always white or gray and always had this, sort of, silvery look to it. And it totally... I hadn't even really...

Nicholas: It's really different. 

Interviewer: ...thought about the way that, like, the lighting is different in my memory, you know, that was kind of strange.

Nicholas: Well, I think that must be an important way in which people understand global warming, is that they have to have something to contrast it to. So, you have to have not only, you know, a number of years over which things have changed in one place, but you also have to think about it relationally, and how somewhere else, you know, has a really different climate map, and how that allows you to recognize, in the place where you are, things that are strange or different. So yeah, this is disturbing. I mean, in the Sierra Foothills, as I mentioned, where I was last week, you look at the tops of trees to see whether they're dying, and people, a lot of people don't have...live connected to a municipal water system. They have their own wells. It's drilled on their land and, you know, the aquifers are getting drier and less abundant, partly because more people are sticking a well into the aquifer but also because the aquifers are just producing less water now. There's less water in the water table or so it seems, you know. That's what people wanna think about.

Interviewer: Great. Very interesting. Okay. Cool. And so, when did the drought start? When did that become a big point of conversation within California? 

Nicholas: So, I'm not sure but I'm guessing something like about seven or eight years ago.

Interviewer: Okay. Great. Because I don't actually know the timeline on that.

Nicholas: I mean, that's just my subjective timeline, which may not align at all with, you know, meteorological realities. And there's always been struggles over water in California. I mean, you know, much of California is, I think, naturally a desert that's been fertilized into being, sort of, super abundant in terms of agriculture. And when you drive, you know, like if you drive down to Los Angeles and you go through all those hours of flat cabbage fields and, you know, garlic patches, and you often see angry signs from farmers about water. And so, water, just water in the...the assignment of water according to a set of, kind of, political and civic priorities is one thing. So, once we've got the water, there are struggles over it because there's more and more of us and there's less and less water.

But that's the kind of social or cultural set of choices, like how much are we gonna give to the farmers, and how much do we need to keep to allow people in Los Angeles to be able to drink when they turn on the tap. But I guess what I'm talking about is something that precedes that is like the thing that's outside our control of water in the sky, but water that isn't in the sky and that isn't falling on us anymore. And so, you know, the California's always had these struggles over water, and struggles with neighboring states, struggles between North and South California because, at least as I understand it, there's a lot of water that comes from the Sierras that gets drained towards Southern California, especially because of Los Angeles.

But then, there's also just this fact that this resource which we depend upon, you know, the cycles of evaporation and precipitation to provide for us, just seems to be going wrong somehow. And one of the things that's poignant about living in Northern California is that...especially in a place like where we are now in Silicon Valley and we're really near the Pacific, we're probably not gonna feel the impact of it that much. And it's really nice now, like we're talking outside in February. If we were doing this on the East Coast, you know, we'd be huddled under in a bus shelter wearing raincoats, right? I mean, it would be cold, but at now, it's actually quite nice here. But it's nice in a mildly disturbing way.

Interviewer: Right. Little bit eerie, little bit incongruous. 

Nicholas: Yeah. A bit eerie. Yeah, exactly. Incongruous or like, "What? What happened? Did I fall asleep for three months and then I woke up and it's actually now May, and not February?"

Interviewer: Okay, yeah. So, one final thing is can you talk a little bit about how your daily experiences, and how your activities and basically, how your interactions with the area have changed over the past 18 years?

Nicholas: Well, so one thing that I can do for longer now is that I like cycling because California around here is a beautiful place to cycle in. Once you get out a little bit further west of 280, which is one of the main 2 freeways on the peninsula, there's a kind of old-fashioned California like almost a 1960s California. It's not exactly farming land, although there are farms out there, but it's just much less developed. And yeah, the all these good things that bring a kind of subtle sense of unease with them, so I can cycle for longer now, because it's not raining so hard. And that's great, but is it?

And, you know, also intergenerationally, my kids...I have two kids, both teenagers. And, you know, kids, young people are always, as they should be, trying to get their parents to behave better. And so, I think, this is in part, a kind of just a natural intergenerational story of parental correction. Correction of parents, not parents correcting somebody else. But, you know, my kids have forbade me and now I wouldn't even think about cleaning my teeth with the tap running, which before, especially when we're getting so much rain here, seem like water is just like oxygen. It's free and there's lots of it. Why do we worry about it? But now, you know, I think I would feel like I'd done something slightly kind of anti-social if I kept the tap running when I was cleaning my teeth.

So, I cycle more. I'm a little bit more prudent about how I use water personally. I think about the change in the visual world that I am surrounded by. I watch nature more. You know, I think in a way another kind of good thing that has a bad thing attached to it, I feel more sensitive to nation than I once did. I probably was a kind of averagely, kind of, insensitive and non-observant person before, but I find that I've got more interested in plants, and temperature, and animals, and trees, and soil, and things like that, just because I now feel a greater sense of fragility about all that and about my relationship to it.

And so, I think it's changed my life, not in any, kind of, radical way, but it's actually made me...climate change has made me a better person. I'm sorry to say it. You know, that's a big price to pay for making me a better person, right? I mean, I wish it could have happened and we didn't have climate change. But I do think that, you know, everybody who's suddenly become more aware of not just profligately consuming things, feeling like there's something incredibly, just, kind of, cheap and sleazy about having a gas-guzzling car. People who just have gardens that consume massive amounts of water, unthinkingly eating fruits or vegetables that consume exorbitant amounts of water as they're grown. Just using resources a little bit more responsibly, I wouldn't claim in any way to have become, you know, fully converted. Now, I'm actually carbon neutral in my movement through the world, but I'm a bit better and that's because of climate change. You know, this crisis has made me just, like, 2% more responsible, but that's too big a price to pay, you know. I mean, I should have done it anyway. 

Interviewer: Great. And when the conscientiousness like enters the conversation is it when people start normalizing, so.

Nicholas: Yeah. I think that's true. I mean, absolutely. And this is a, kind of, gathering wave, I think, that, you know, lots of people start off by doing small things and that cumulatively can add up to something, but eventually, you know, people build on their reactions and they get more involved and the crisis probably gets more serious as well. And so, you have to start with this gentle, kind of, persuasion of people who don't immediately see what the stake is and then converting their conscientiousnesses a bit. People like me. Yeah, it's huge. And then, meantime, the way that people can really probably best appreciate it, if they're not directly involved as scientists or policy makers, is by looking at the sky, and watching the plants, and missing the animals, and seeing how the color of their world has changed.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you so much.

Nicholas: My pleasure.

Interviewer: Thanks for conversation.

Nicholas: Yeah, I enjoyed it.
