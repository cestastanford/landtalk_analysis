Interviewee: Well, we moved here as a young couple with a little baby in 1964. And we lived south of town. And Bloomington was much smaller then, for sure. Downtown was interesting. It was mostly stores on the square that surrounded the courthouse. And most of them were privately owned stores. Like Smith Shoe Store, of course, the bank, several other stores, gift shops, that sort of thing. But the only chain store that was there, that I can remember, was JCPenney.

Woman: Downtown?

Interviewee: Downtown JC...

Woman: There's Woolworths.

Interviewee: Well, yes. There was Woolworths on the corner too. But JCPenney was interesting because we knew the manager of that store. And he said that the city was planning a development out here on the east side of town, which wasn't developed at all. I mean, this was all...the east side was all just farm country. And that development, he was said that he was...He took the job as manager at Penny's because they promised him that they would be building a JCPenney store in a beautiful mall. And indeed they did. So, that's how we got College Mall. So, College Mall, the two main stores, of course, were JCPenney and Sears.

Interviewer: Right, and they're both gone.

Interviewee: They're both gone, right.

Interviewer: They're both gone.

Interviewee: But the town itself didn't really have much else. If you wanted to do any shopping, you really had to go up to Indianapolis. Everybody went to Indianapolis to shop. Because there really wasn't much of anything here, that we were grateful for the JCPenney. All the clothes I bought for my children were JCPenney clothes because that's what we had here in Bloomington. In fact, one time if they had something you didn't...If you needed something they didn't have, then you had to go to the Montgomery Ward's catalog store, which was just around the corner, sort of, like around the Buskirk-Chumley Theater is now, but I think the next block up. Just a little storefront store, nothing on display at all. Just a store with books in it where you could look through the catalog and decide what you wanted to order. Well, I needed boots from my little children, rubber boots, and they didn't have any at the JCPenney store, so I had to go...

Interviewer: They didn't have rain boots?

Interviewee: They didn't have rain boots, no. So, I had to go to the catalog store and order boots for them. I remember that specifically. The other interesting thing about the stores was that they all closed on Wednesday afternoon.

Interviewer: On Wednesdays.

Interviewee: Wednesdays afternoon. At noon, everything downtown closed up. The bank closed. Social Security office closed. All the stores closed at noon on Wednesday afternoon, and everybody headed out to the golf course. All these business people, they all went play golf Wednesday afternoons.

Interviewer: So the golf course that's now going to be the hospital or a different golf course?

Interviewee: Cascades, I believe is the one that they went to.

Man: No, it's Cascades.

Interviewee: Yeah. So, that was interesting. Where I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was also a university town, all the stores didn't close on Wednesday afternoon. So, that was interesting. So, yeah.

Interviewer: What have you noticed in terms of like trees, plants, animal changes?

Interviewee: Well, of course, there was a lot more open space then, of course, with all the farm country. But even downtown, it seems like all of our buildings are getting taller and closer together. The downtown area is growing, growing, growing. And in order to get some greenery, they're putting in median strips with big pots for greenery, which certainly wasn't the case before. It was lots of trees before.

Interviewer: Yeah. Would you say there were as many deer then like there are now in Bloomington?

Interviewee: I wasn't aware of all the deer. I think that there were more woods for them to be in. So, now they're losing their habitat and so they're becoming a nuisance by getting in at people's yards. In fact, in our yard, in the back of our yard is the railroad track that runs through from Bloomington up to Indianapolis. And well, it was a mama deer and two probably yearlings went through just this morning. So, they're regular visitors. And we even have had foals born out there. So, they're losing their habitat, and so they're becoming a nuisance. Not for me. I make sure I've got a clear path for them to go through back there. But yeah, they're a nuisance to a lot of people. 

The other big change as far as topography goes, the railroad track that is now the Beeline Trail was a working railroad line. It was a working railroad. And it really cut off and separated the east side of Bloomington from the west side of Bloomington. If you had to go to the hospital in the ambulance, sometimes they had to wait for the train to pass to get through. And it was several years after that, that they ended up doing that tunnel underneath the railroad line, you know which one I'm talking about? Over there by the convention center, yeah.

Interviewer: Yeah I do.

Interviewee: So, that was that was built specifically so that ambulances could get over to the hospital more easily. So, yeah, that's topography that's been changed for sure.

Interviewer: Do you feel like as many trains go by your house as they used to?

Interviewee: Yes, I'd say there's more trains.

Interviewer: More trains?

Interviewee: Yes, but it's still not annoying. There's maybe three a day or so.

Woman: Yeah, I think when I was a kid there was like one a day.

Interviewee: You think so?

Woman: Yeah.

Interviewee: I don't know.

Interviewer: More use of this train track.

Interviewee: Right. Well, it used to be primarily almost exclusively for hauling coal for the university.

Woman: Indiana Power and Light.

Interviewee: Yeah. So, all these coal cars would be going by filled with coal, and that's what they did, that's what they mostly transported. Then I'd say maybe five years ago, they upgraded the railroad line, put in stronger ties, upgraded the rails. And as a result, they were able to increase the speed of the trains going by. So, it is much more heavily used. Not so much with coal. Occasionally we'll see coal, but very rarely really. But a lot of lumber and a lot of shipping containers. I mean, they're just hauling these big shipping containers, one stacked on top of another, you know, maybe two, three, four engines pulling a train that's basically shipping containers.

Interviewer: What do you miss most about living here 20 years ago?

Interviewee: Twenty years ago?

Interviewer: Or we can go 55.

Interviewee: What do I miss most? Oh, I gotta think. It's still a friendly community and that's the basic thing you want. Especially in a college town, you want people who are neighborly and friendly, and that's good.

Woman: How about not having a rush hour?

Interviewer: Maybe you miss that.

Interviewee: Yeah. We didn't use to have a rush hour.

Woman: No, we didn't.

Interviewee: But yeah, yeah, that is a difference, the amount of traffic on the roads now, it's quite a bit.

Woman: I remember you used to complain about rush hour and there'd be like five cars in front of us. I remember that as a kid that you hated going around in rush hour and there were, like, literally five cars in front of us at the lights.

Interviewee: Yeah. And also, it seems like they're always building on the road. You know? They're improving the roads, a lot of construction, and that also slows things down, especially now with I-69. That was really a hassle for a while. It's nice now, but that really slowed things down and it was dangerous for people. A lot of people died with that construction.

Man: We had people here who would like to have had a ride from us. And they apologize profusely because they lived on the other side of town and it would take at least 10 or 15 minutes to get there and pick them up.

Interviewee: So, it takes a lot longer to get across town now because more traffic lights and more traffic.

Woman: What weather changes have you seen?

Interviewee: I think it was colder in the wintertimes. I think we had more snow.

Woman: Yeah, we definitely did, as a kid.

Interviewee: Yeah. Now we maybe get three snows that are more than three inches in the whole winter, and that's it. So, the poor children nowadays do not get a good chance to build snowmen.

Woman: Snow forts.

Interviewer: We don't. We don't get very many snow days?

Interviewee: Yeah. Not very many snow days.

Interviewer: Not very many snow days.

Woman: You only get ice days, you really don't get snow days particularly.

Interviewer: Do you remember any big snowstorms?

Interviewee: Actually, not here especially, except that a few years ago, about 15 years ago, there was a really big snowstorm, it was like 12 inches.

Woman: There's the blizzard of '78.

Interviewee: Yes, and with that one, a neighbor came and helped shovel off the driveway. He had a snowplow, so that was really helpful. Ordinarily, we'd always just shovel it off ourselves, but 12 inches was too much. And then, of course, the big blizzard of '76.

Woman: '78. Was it '78? '76? Oh, it was right when we got back, wasn't it?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Woman: So, that'd be '76.

Interviewee: Yeah, '76 and then there was another shutdown of some kind a couple of years later.

Woman: You can keep talking.

Interviewee: Yeah, there was that big blizzard. And that was an adventure because it happened on the day that your mother was having a birthday party, a sleepover birthday party at our house.

Interviewer: January.

Interviewee: January. And our water pipe froze, so we had no water. And we had somebody come out to defrost the pipe, water blind pipe. He was here all night long, was not able to get it defrosted. So, we were trying to melt snow in order to have some water for flushing the toilet. You know, it takes a long time to melt snow and you don't get very much, so that was an adventure. But that cold went on so long they actually shut down the university for a couple of weeks, which is really rare for the university to be shut down.

Interviewer: They canceled one day of classes this year, it's a really big deal.

Interviewee: Right. So, what we ended up doing was going down to visit our grandmother in Florida. And on the way back, we were hoping that our waterpipes hadn't burst. And fortunately, none of the water pipes had burst. So we were okay. But yeah, that was an advanture. It was like six weeks that we had no water.

Interviewer: That's crazy.

Woman: I remember it well. And we were like showering at the neighbor's house.

Interviewee: Yeah, we did take a few showers at the neighbor's house. Ran a pipe from the neighbor...a horse from the neighbor here to our house or some water. The problem was our water line pipe was buried underneath the driveway, but much too shallow. So that when the ground froze, the pipe would freeze as well. And the other environmental thing was this year, which is really unusual, we have been in this house for over 50 years and we have never had a flood in our house, never, this is the first time in 50 years that we have had that, and that was this winter. The water was up in the back yard, came up almost to where it rises up. And there was so much ground saturation that the water was seeping in on the lower level, just all along the walls. Yeah. So, that was unusual and I don't know if that has anything to do with climate change that's going on now or not. But I think we all have to expect more problems with weather changes.

Interviewer: I bet we do. Okay, thank you for your time.

Interviewee: You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah, that was good. Thank you, [inaudible 00:14:20].
