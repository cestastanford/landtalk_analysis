Interviewer: You grew up in this house. Could you tell me a little bit about where it's located on and what the front yard of the house looked like?

Margo: So, the house is in San Jose, very close to the border of Campbell. And the street that it's on is unusually wide and that the house is on a corner. So the front yard kind of goes around the house in the front and there's two sides to it, the front yard, because of it being on a corner. So starting from the driveway, there was lawn and three very large liquidambar trees and then a path to the front of the house and then more lawn that went around the corner towards the neighbor's house where there were four or five very tall redwood trees. And then there was some random planting along the house itself at the edge of the lawn, so between the lawn and the house.

Interviewer: Gotcha. Could you talk a little bit more about the types of plants you had in front of the house?

Margo: So, they were primarily just bushes, as I remember, no flowers per se and kind of nondescript. There were some bushes that produced flowers but they were largely kind of the same color of green and, like I said, they went around the two sides of the house and most of the front yard really was grass, and then the big, tall trees at sort of both ends of it. Now along the driveway, on the other side of the driveway in between our house and the neighbor's house, there were lots of flowers planted in that strip right there along the driveway. It was kind of nondescript, if that makes sense. It wasn't a very interesting yard.

Interviewer: So why do you think that it's changed over the past, you know, 20 plus years?

Margo: So my mom decided that she wanted to do something different with it for two reasons. One was that because we were on a corner and the front yard was largely grass, there were people, kids, teenagers, we're not really sure who, who would cut across the lawn rather than stopping at the stop sign and making that right hand turn. And so my parents would get up in the morning and find that somebody had gone over the lawn and with a motorcycle tire and just left a big long block line in the watt [SP] and that got really old.

Other thing was, is California as it, you know, pretty regularly went through a drought and my parents decided, particularly my mom, that she wanted to plant things that didn't need as much water. And so, when she designed it, she put in all drought-tolerant plants that didn't need a lot of water. And actually there was a third reason too, which is that, while the lawn was usable there was no like community space in the front of the house and so she also designed a front patio with a wall around it so that we could sit outside and have like lunch or dinner outside on the patio in the front.

Interviewer: Okay, great. So as the plants and trees changed, did you notice that there was a change in the types of animals that came around the front yard?

Margo: There certainly were a lot more birds because when she first had the planting done it was kind of barren because it was just dirt with very small plants. And as the plants grew and produced more foliage and more flowers, there were definitely more birds around. Beyond that, I mean, other than stray cats, there weren't a ton of animals in the neighborhood. We did use to have gophers before she didâ€¦redid the yard and those gophers actually went away because with the kinds of planting that she did, it wasn't the sort of thing they ate. And so that, in a good way, that got rid of the gophers, they went to find other places.

Interviewer: Gotcha, okay, great. Those are all the questions I have. Do you have any final thoughts?

Margo: I don't think so. I mean, I think the only thought, the final thought I had was that although when I was really little and I liked having the lawn and being able to play on it, but once I got older, the yard was so much more beautiful with the planting that she did, rather than having the lawn.

Interviewer: Gotcha, okay, great. Thank you so much for your time.

Margo: You're welcome.
