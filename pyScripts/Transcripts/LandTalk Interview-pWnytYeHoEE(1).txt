Interviewer: So what year did you move to Portland?

Interviewee: I think it must have been 1995.

Interviewer: Cool. You moved to Lake Oswego, which is technically outside of Portland, but the same area.

Interviewee: Yeah. Just outside.

Interviewer: For part of this project I have to submit pictures, and one of the things that I found was, like, the really striking difference between how the Pearl District looked in, like, 1997 to now. 

Interviewee: Oh good, mm-hmm.

Interviewer: Because, like, the picture I found from 1997, the Pearl District is pretty much a rail yard.

Interviewee: Wow, yeah. Well, there's always the rail yard across the river, but even on the downtown side, there was a big rail yard there? See, I don't even...

Interviewer: That's what I found. It was an historic picture of the Pearl. Do you remember any of that, kind of when the Pearl started...

Interviewee: Not really. I mean, what I remember, and I talked with Dad a little bit about this, you know, before, one of the earliest forays that I would make into what is now the Pearl District or called the Pearl District was, you know, where the North Park Blocks are?

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. 

Interviewee: There used to be a big fabric store there called Daisy Kingdom, which was kind of fun, and so we'd go over there. And the bus station, and the train station, you know, were sort of up in that general direction. But the part that's now the Pearl District just seemed to be kind of warehouses and kind of light industrial that you wouldn't go to unless you had a reason, you know? It wasn't a place that you would, as a resident, you know, wander in. So I don't remember ever going there until...

Interviewer: You could describe sort of how it looked?

Interviewee: Well, I didn't get much off the Park Blocks and the places I had reason to go, so I guess I can't really describe it first-hand that way. Until we started kind of...until the first things started opening up in the Pearl District, so, like, the restaurant Bluehour, and I don't know if you can think of it, it's that...I think it's 13th that it's on, which has some weird kind of warehouse-y buildings with elevated sidewalks on either side. Can you imagine...

Interviewer: Yeah, no, I've been to Bluehour. I've been around there. 

Interviewee: ...the ones I'm talking about? Yeah, and so up and down on that street, by the time we started to go there, which was probably...I don't know. If we moved in 1995 it was probably after 2000 that we went a couple of times. We had little kids. We didn't go all the time. There were art galleries there, and sort of funky design shops, furniture. It was kind of...it seems like that's the street that sort of began to open up kind of the Pearl and the whole First Thursday thing. And it was kind of scruffy, but the art galleries and the design shops kind of moved in there. But again, it's not like I wandered around in the streets where there wasn't anything to go to. But I know, just walking around there now, there used to be some old...or not now, but more recently, there used to be some old, like, tool and die machine bearing places, things that you certainly wouldn't find there anymore. 

Interviewer: Yeah, so, what is...if you could describe the Pearl now, how would you describe it?

Interviewee: Well, that first wave of kind of more independent galleries and shops has kind of given way. Of course, they've built a lot of housing, a lot of fancy condos, and apartments, and high-rises in that general area. I mean, I'm taking a kind of liberal view of what's called the Pearl District. It's sort of the Pearl District and surround. So it's kind of gotten settled. They've built parks, and a lot of housing, and all the sort of attendant retail that goes with housing, but the galleries have moved out. And the sort of funky shops, there's a few left, maybe, but it seems like what they've mostly been replaced with are things like Whole Foods, and Sur La Table, and Title Nine, which I love, but it's national, it's not, like, a local business. And places, kind of boutiques, and places that are not necessarily local to Portland anymore. Kind of upscale retail, and dining, and that sort of thing. And I'm...it's not all true, but there's certainly more of that now than there was then. I think in the early days that Weinhard's Brewery still made beer down there by Powell's, and Powell's was kind of in the scruffy north end of town, and now it's surrounded by all that pretty upscale...Anthropologie and that kind of store. 

Interviewer: Yeah. So I guess, if we're talking about the Pearl, it's like, what are some of the things that you used to do here, you, like, didn't really used to go to the Pearl, because it was not really a place that you went. 

Interviewee: It's true. I mean, like I said, there were a couple places like Daisy Kingdom, or Powell's, would sort of take you up into that... Oh, bummer. Would take you up into that area just to visit those places, but it wasn't like a wander around and explore kind of place, at least not for me.

Interviewer: And now it kind of is. 

Interviewee: Now it is, yeah, and it's continuing, I mean, as we speak, they...I mean, it's sort of moved out, like into Slabtown now, so, you know, the area has expanded, but the building certainly hasn't stopped. And I would say it not only extends sort of north now into what they call Slabtown, and kind of heading up towards NW 23rd, and even across the river, the closed-in neighborhoods are getting redeveloped with condos, and housing, and retail, and stuff. So it's really...I mean, I don't know, I'm not an urban planner, but I feel like the city, not unlike other cities, but really kind of redeveloping from the inside out, you know?

Interviewer: Yeah. 

Interviewee: With attendant costs and benefits, so.

Interviewer: Definitely. Yeah, I think that's all I really have to ask you. But I don't know, if you could say one thing about how Portland has changed, what would it be?

Interviewee: You mean, like, this area that we're talking about, or the city as a whole? What do you think?

Interviewer: Either, I think. Justâ€¦

Interviewee: I would say that on the one hand, that it's a mixed blessing, that...as gentrification and redevelopment often is. And if you have the sort of money, and transportation, and wherewithal to enjoy it, it's very nice, and it feels prosperous, and safe, and interesting. But it's lost some of the funkiness, the galleries and that whole scene has had to move elsewhere, and that sort of continues to retreat to other sort of lower-rent districts of the city. So it's still there, it's just a moving target to go find it if you're interested. And I do, I guess...you know the...I feel like even that sort of Pearl area is, it's starting to lose its character. It's like, the businesses you can find there you can find in California or in other places. It's not sort of unique and funky anymore. But it's very nice. 

Interviewer: Yeah. 

Interviewee: So I don't know.
