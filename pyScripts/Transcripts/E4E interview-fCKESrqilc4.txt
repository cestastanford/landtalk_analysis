Interviewer: Mom are you ready? 

Kim: Yes.

Interviewer: Can you just state your first and last name? 

Kim: Kim Radcliffe. 

Interviewer: So just like, can you just describe what just like a yard looked like in terms of landscape or like whether plants or animals, like when you first moved there? 

Kim: Well, it's a flat small yard plus it's surrounded in the back, it's bordered in the back by a strong and it's bordered on one side by bushes and basically bushes and flowering shrubs. And when we first moved here, the swamp was much more overgrown and there was less water and more vegetation versus now. The shrubs were smaller, there was a large willow tree standing there… 

Interviewer: Is there any kind of like animal, like infestation or something like that in the yard? 

Kim: There has been underneath, I guess they're mice as you can tell, or mice in the backyard. I don't know of any other animals other than like squirrels.

Interviewer: And you can just talk about a little bit more about, like what's some of the biggest changes that have occurred over the last 20 or some years?

Kim: Yes, well definitely as I mentioned, the swamp being it's much more like a pond now as opposed to lots of vegetation. Part of that is beavers which have come in, so they're now beavers and there was a beaver dam recently a beaver dam nearby. So beavers have come over and have started to eat a lot of the trees and branches. In terms of our backyard, there are some small flower type plants that have grown into the grass, where they once were just a border between the grass and our barn but they've kind of moved into the grass and they are now flowering within the grass.

There's a lot more dead grass too, so it's harder to keep it well nourished. A lot of the vegetation has grown obviously the provide trees are much bigger growing over and through the fence. And the other small bushes have grown quite a bit. 

Interviewer: Cool, what's that?

Kim:  Can you hold for one second? 

Interviewer: Can you just talk a little bit about what some of the things that you used to do there versus like some of the things you do now? I guess you can talk about something you used to like use the yard for. I mean, I know that was a garden there before but I don't know  if there's anything else, like when you first moved there.

Kim: We would play out there a lot more, you know, we don't spend much time out there as much. I'm trying to…

Interviewer: Just like sports you're saying? 

Kim: Yes, just sports in the backyard but we just don't spend time back there. I used to garden a bit more but I don't do that quite as much 

Interviewer: Cause the soil and stuff like?

Kim: Yeah, it seems a little more uneven than it used to be. And so it's not quite as pleasant to walk on quite as easy as, it's just a little bit more bumpy than it used to be. 

Interviewer: Just the leveling of the soil. 

Kim: Yes and, again, the grass isn't quite as nice as it used to be. It's a little sparser like clumpier [inaudible 00:05:32] on ice. It's not sort of even coverage. It's more like can you see the dirt a little bit more between the clumps, you know, it's just not quite as dense. The grass blades themselves aren't quite as [inaudible 00:05:50]. And the big willow tree that fell down was sprouting up some additional branches and trees, but the beavers cut those towns. So beavers, it's kind of ruined what had been sort of a second growth of the willow tree that had fallen from a storm. So, even though the willow tree fell down, it was sort of becoming a tree and has a slightly different form but now the beavers have really destroyed that. 

The beavers destroyed quite a bit in that swamp. They ate quite a bit both in the swamp and in the yard and our neighbor's yard very quickly. In just a matter of days they took down whatever they could get at in terms of the trees or the types of branches that they eat. So, that's a big change I guess. 

Interviewer: Definitely, and I guess is there just like anything like that you guys what you would say that you used, the yard is used for particular now I mean just like…? 

Kim: Really just, we don't sit back there anymore, I hang the laundry back there because there's a sunny spot to hang the laundry. I'll occasionally do a little bit of gardening back there but not too much. It's all kind of overgrown in the borders. We do get, just try to, you know, put grass seed down and put the, you know, various things on it to keep it nice and green but it's kind of constant, constant battle for that.

Interviewer: It's all right if there isn't a whole lot. 

Kim: We don't spend much time out there.

Interviewer: Yeah. All right.
