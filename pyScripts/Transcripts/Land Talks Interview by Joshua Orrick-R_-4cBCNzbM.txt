Joshua: This is Joshua Orrick and I'm doing my land talk conversation about Lake Lagunita at Stanford University. I'm here interviewing Hanna Scott. Hanna, how do you describe the way Lake Lagunita used to look?

Hanna: Back when it was full, Lake Lag had green grass growing on the side, the water was beautiful and still, and we would just sit out there and hang out by the lake, and it felt like summer camp even if it was in the middle of winter.

Joshua: So how can you describe how it has changed over the years?

Hanna: Now the grass that was growing on the banks has completely dried up. It is like dust and weeds and brown and obviously there is no water and so it just looks like a giant empty pit.

Joshua: That is a shame. And so what are some things you used to do there when there was water?

Hanna: Some brave people would swim in it or paddle board on it, or sit in rafts in the water, but everyone would just sit by the...sit on the shores and play frisbee, and sunbathe and just hang out and it was like the perfect spot.

Joshua: So what are some of the things that you do there now, now that there is no water?

Hanna: Now I would only go to Lake Lag if I'm running around it, which is still kind of depressing, or if I'm trying to take a shortcut to get to the other side of campus.

Joshua: Got it. Okay. Well thank you so much for your time, Hanna.

Hanna: Thank you.
