Eva: So how did this place before?

Mary: Well, I first moved here when I was 5 so that was 48 years ago, and at that time it was the very, very edge of development for the Twin Cities metropolitan area. So it was unimaginative housing in cul-de-sacs and horseshoe kind of developments, and then beyond that, it was mostly undeveloped land, and it was mostly sort of scrub forest, undeveloped land. So that's what it looked like...that's what I remember when you know, that would have been 1970 or so. So it was the edge of the urban development at that time 40 years ago now it's...

Steve: Now, it's the heart of the suburbs.

Mary: Yeah. 

Steve: It's almost completely developed at this point but it would have been...where we are now would have been a lot of open land, a lot of undeveloped prairie and woodland. That is now almost completely developed from the 1980s up through you know, even just several years ago with the houses. You know, the houses progressing with the architectural trends of those times.

Mary: I think if we call Roseville our first tier...our first-rate suburbs, Shoreview is the second range suburb. The last I heard there's, at least in Arden Hills, I don't know if it's true in Shoreview, there's no more buildable lots so it's completely developed and 20 minutes from each downtown.

Steve: And then within the time that we've you know, just within very recent time, John, your Uncle John, built his house in what was essentially an undeveloped field that is...you know, just in the last 10 or 15 years has turned...has started looking a lot like Shoreview here. And we've literally watched the wave of development approach here, reach here and then pass us and then keep sort of expanding outward to you know, quite a ways north of this from downtown.

Eva: So then how has it changed? 

Mary: Okay, so I mean, besides the obvious, which is the construction of new homes and the building of a suburban community, the...So it's been a suburb for 40 years but it was you know, on the ragged edge of development 40 years ago and now it's you know, smack in the middle of the suburban ring around the Twin Cities. But the biggest thing I've noticed is, I grew up here, I was outside all the time, I was a tomboy. I played in the woods all the time and the thing that I notice, the biggest change I notice it's quite significant and it's big is that when I grew up here, a lot of the wildlife that we have, we had then we have now, except some very significant differences in that. When I grew up here there were no large birds, none. So there were no eagles, no not even herons.

Seve: No ospreys.

Mary: No ospreys, none, zero, no trumpeter swans, no turkeys, no hawks.

Steve: No hawks.

Mary: No owls. And we...now we have all of those in abundance, like all of them we have, and we have lots of them, they're everywhere. The turkeys are so numerous now they're actually considered a nuisance. And that's a huge change in the last 40 years.

Steve: And I think mom is right, that would have been that's 1970s would have been just at the tail end of DDT. When they were discovering that that pesticide DDT affected the viability of eggs of raptors. And especially bald eagles and so you know, we've literally watched the recovery of that entire you know, stratum of the predator ecosystem, essentially recover 100% in our lifetime.

Mary: Right, so that's an enormous like success, I would say, those things were not anywhere and now they're here in great abundance, loons, everything. But I think it's been balanced with an equally sad loss, which is when we grew up here there were...there was at the end of the gravel like a dead end where there was development, it's that swamp down by the TV towers, by gammy's houses. There was a mound of snakes, it was like not a pit but a mound and it was all red-bellied snakes. And they would...I mean, there must have been thousands if not tens of thousands of these little harmless red-belly snakes. There were salamanders, and everybody's window bar, you know, the little box that goes around your basement window, what do you call that?

Steve: Yeah, the...

Mary: Anyway, everybody...I mean, every log you overturned there was an amphibian, there was a salamander, or a frog or there were snakes and so. And those animals are gone. I mean, we have some in our backyard here on Turtle Lake, I think partly because the previous owner didn't use any pesticides, he was an environmentalist and we haven't. So this house is, our few acres here on Turtle Lake has probably been pesticide free for probably over 30 years.

We have some, we have frogs, we saw salamanders when we moved in and haven't seen one since. So anyways, and I think that's probably most people believe that's from Roundup, what's the Atrazine, whatever.

Steve: No, Atrazine is the stronger one.

Mary: Anyways, whatever the active ingredient is in Roundup. So we saw the DDT problem and all the large birds came back. But then we're you know, we haven't outlawed yet DDT or the active ingredient DDT and it's killing off all the amphibians at, you know, quite a fast pace. So that's the biggest change.

Steve: Although I would say the other thing that we've noticed you know, once you stay in a place long enough. Another thing you notice in that you know, [inaudible 00:07:02] of us have noticed is that what seems like a trend that's only going in one direction will often reverse, right? 

So we've lived through a drought when we first got here that at first looked like it was very explicitly related to global warming. Our little lake without any input or output was down almost three-feet, a three-foot drop in the water level for only a 500-acre lake. And we felt at the time that that was clearly related to global warming and that it was only going in one direction. And in our lifetime with no change to how the lake was constructed that has come back. And we've been here where there have been lots and lots of foxes and then no foxes and then foxes again. We had deer all throughout our backyard in lots of winters and for the last two winters, we haven't seen any, literally zero deer this entire winter and so.

Mary: But they will be back, like I think those cycles a lot of those are natural, there are rabbits you know, the foxes. This year we had a whole bunch of coyotes, really a lot of coyote's and I think...

Steve: Which may be related to the deer.

Mary: Why we don't have deer around. So there are some natural cycles you know, and the scientists know that foxes are on like a seven year cycle because of mange and other things. So there are some natural cycles but those ones I was talking about with the birds and the amphibians I think are outside the range of natural and outside the range of normal.

Steve: The amphibians certainly seem like a steady downturn, like a steady graph line going down. But that's...I guess if you talk about what has changed I do think that that's a good thing to know from somebody who's been in one place for a very long time. Which is that you think something is in some kind of inevitable decline and you know, nature in a small scale is actually really awfully resilient and we've seen a lot of both ups and downs.

Mary: Yeah, I can speak to the other thing that you know, we're talking about environment here is that I think, I don't know for certain, but I think the lake has actually got cleaner over the last 40 years, don't you think?

Steve: I do.

Mary: You know, they stocked the lake for fishing so it's hard to just you know, the numbers of fish caught or whatever is not an indicator. But I just think I...they do take measurements about lake clarity and stuff and I think people got smart about not dumping waste. So I think the lake has actually gotten cleaner but that would be something that could be looked up by with the DNR. 

Steve: And the other thing that's happened is that when we were kids all of the motors on the boats on the lake would have been two stroke oil and gas mixture motors  which are really, really polluting. And now the majority of them probably we have switched over to what I call four stroke engines which is a much cleaner, it's still a dirty...it's still burning gasoline but compared to a two stroke engine it's much cleaner. So I think a lot of the boats on the lake are burning less fuel and are burning it more efficiently and probably putting more less petroleum into the water.

Eva: So what are some of the things that you used to do here?

Mary: Well, as a kid we were at the edge of development so what we did is we played in the woods. And so it's, what's interesting is you know, we did all the same things that people do now, you know, we were outside, we went skating, swimming. I used to swim for 12 hours at a time, I used to skate for eight hours at a time. Everybody had little warming houses and you know, along the edge of the lake or they opened up their basements so you can go in and get warm. So all the activities are the same, they're just done differently now which is really interesting. So there is less and less of undeveloped open land, I'd say there's still some undeveloped land but it's all private so you don't feel like you could go build a ford on it.

But you know, today there's hiking trails all over, miles and miles and miles of hiking trails that never existed before so you can be out in woods but you're sort of...it's sort of prescribed a little bit for you. I mean, I remember going sliding and we used to you know, walk in the woods and we'd have to literally like clear fell trees to make a...you know, clear a hill of downed trees to go sliding. Now, of course, you know, there are parks and there are sliding hills and they're maintained by the city and it's you know, so the all the same activities but performed differently.

Steve: I think and just in general too, you saw way more kids out unsupervised when we were kids. Like they would be out on the lake and they would be doing pick-up ice hockey games and they would be doing pick-up basketball. And they would be playing sandlot baseball wherever they could find an open enough you know, square of grass. And you know, the closest we get to that is probably our local park where the only time we ever see kids out there are either skateboarding or they're playing organized sports. They're practicing for a team, either baseball or soccer or they're playing games with the team organized by the local athletic association. But there...I can't think of the last time that I've seen just a bunch of kids out organizing themselves into a game of either ice hockey on the lake or you know, some sort of pick-up game.

Mary: No, it doesn't happen.

Steve: It just doesn't happen and that's absolutely, that's what changed literally 100% in our lifetime.

Mary: Yeah.

Eva: So you already sort of started to answer this, but what are some of the things that you do now? 

Mary: Here, yeah. 

Steve: So we go walking on trails a lot.

Mary: Yeah, we walk trails most days.

Steve: And you can't just go out your back door and walk anywhere you want. You've got to go to the specified trail that's been clear because there are you know, there are houses where there used to be woods. Another thing I think that we can say that we've noticed really recently is that it used to be that pretty much all winter long you could downhill ski or cross country ski, like pretty much from December almost through March. It was a guarantee that most days in that stretch of time you could ski somewhere, and that's gotten really tentative. So we've seen a lot of cancelled...

Mary: For sure.

Steve: Dog races up north where they used to do sled dog races, we've seen a lot of cancelled especially cross-country ski races in this area. And it's because it's...that seems very clearly to be related to warmer winters.

Mary: Yeah, we always have to...at Kowalski's, the grocery store the other day, and you know, a man walked in who clearly worked there. And everybody said, "Hey, you're not supposed to work today what are you doing in?" And he said the finals, the state champion for their Nordic team got cancelled due to warm weather and they weren't gonna reschedule because they didn't foresee it getting cold enough. Though kind of interesting.

Steve: And in fact, Joe and I was just out ice fishing yesterday on the lake and it was 37 degrees and the ice was melting which, and this is...

Mary: In January.

Steve: This is the middle of January, this is absolutely, should be the coldest weekend of the entire year. And we're out there in relatively light jackets, hats and mittens and we were fine for three hours on the ice which is just sort of unheard of in January.

Mary: So the weather's way more variable as you know, as you know, we've had some super mild winters but we've also had these what do they call them? The polar...

Steve: The polar vortex, yeah.

Mary: The polar vortex, so we've had some probably more mild winters than not but we've also had these extreme, extreme cold winters so way more variability.

Steve: But the general trend is definitely to warmer winters. I just don't remember winters being just consistently warm when I was a kid.

Eva: All right, well, that is all my questions.
