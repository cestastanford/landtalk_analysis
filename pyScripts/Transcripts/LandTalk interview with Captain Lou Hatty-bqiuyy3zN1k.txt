Captain Lou: Hey guys, I'm Captain Lou. We are on private property. It's been in my family for more than nine generations. You known going back into the day when I heard stories, especially in the bigger waterways you see today throughout our community where families used to be able to have conversations in small waterways like this one, across, with one house on one side and the other house on the other side. You could invite each other over for dinner. Up to today, the biggest change I have seen is coastal erosion. Now you gotta to yell or use one of these things phones to get the message across the bayous in some of these waterways that several acres of lands away from shorelines. Houses, cemeteries and such had to have been pushed back away from the water level, water edges, because of costal erosion. As bad as ... coffins poking out of the ground. Some of the biggest differences more or less is coastal erosion.

Interviewer: How has that affected the wildlife population?

Captain Lou: The wildlife population has been... If you are a hunter, it's good because it focuses most of the animals to one location - to higher ground. Very few high grounds left. And the way of life, it has created more water for shrimping and more shrimping estuaries and hatcheries and things like that, but it took away a lot of bird nesting. The Louisiana state bird - the Brown Pelican will survive off of barrier islands and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico so they have to travel for food. There's no more barrier islands out there, so now they've moved inland.

Interviewer: Now what would you consider the main reason for all of the coastal erosion?

Captain Lou: Coastal erosion persists during the first time the oil companies manually created water ways to have faster and safer access to the Gulf of Mexico. Which then opened up channels and inlets that allowed salt water to come into the freshwater environments. Since then, salt water has been the biggest issue. Second would be hurricanes because that pushes more salt water in.

Captain Lou: Now, we are in fresh water now but that's only because of man made projects called freshwater diversion and that all comes from from snow melt from the northern United States and Canada which traditionally comes down every year down the Missisippi. But now we have piping system that allows us to get out fresh water. Years ago this was not green, of course today doesn't do it justice because we are int he first stages of winter and the leaves have already started falling, but our spring we're getting all the native flowers back because of the fresh water.

Interviewer: You talked about the tourism in this area and the impact of the some of the boats that come through here.

Captain Lou: Yes, on top of shrimping vessels which have been here since the beginning of time, you have a newer style of boat called air boats that travel in the swamps. They get you in much deeper, but the only way they can get you there is in shallow water, which means coastlines. They guys will travel several inches off the coastline and that makes a powerful wave. That's been good bit of the wetlands that we've seen lost locally here in our private swamps.

Interviewer: I'm interesting in hearing more about what has changed in terms of your lifestyle out here - in terms of whether or not people live here, continue to live here, and what's changed in the last 30 years.

Captain Lou: In a sense of more of the local thing - the stuff you see in the movies - where people are waking up in the swamps in their houses and their buildings passed on through generations. You don't have that anymore. Part of the reason is due to coastal erosion - but the biggest reason is - because the coastal erosion would wash away the houses now.

Captain Lou: But the biggest reason is the competing with foreign companies and the farm raising issue of our number one industry, which is shrimping. And you also have other than shrimp farming, from Taiwan these shrimp are brought in vessels - you know, 1000 foot vessels - with billions of pounds of shrimp on 'em for less than a dollar a pound. We are also competing with catfish farming, gator farming... so it just doesn't pay to live in the swamp anymore. Literally, it doesn't pay.

Interviewer: So the people that still live out here and do that are mainly just subsisting on their own?

Captain Lou: People that have no other option either. No education. That's all they know how to do.

Interviewer: Ok and just to end, you are Captain Lou and we are on a swamp tour - and what's the name of your swamp tour?

Captain Lou: I'm Bayou Self Swamp Adventures 'cause I do all private tours, so we're "Bayou Self".

Interviewer: And we've been out here and we've been seeing Great Blue Herons, and Brown Pelicans, and I you take a look over here you may be able to see one of the alligators that we've witnessed. Around this area, this is all part of Captain Lou's family property that has been passed down over - you said 10 generations?

Captain Lou: More than 9 generations because it was claimed hundreds of years before the Battle of New Orleans. It was only since the Battle of New Orleans that this area has been claimed personal property.

Interviewer: Great, thank you very much. Do you want to share anything else? ... Very good, thanks so much.
