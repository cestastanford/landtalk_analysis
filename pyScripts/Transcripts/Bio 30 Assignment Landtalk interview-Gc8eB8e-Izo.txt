Interviewer: Hello, I'm speaking with Joanne Durvey [SP] today about changes in the past 20 years in Virginia Beach, Virginia. So, if we want to get started. My first question for you is, how have you seen Virginia Beach change over the past 20 years? Just kind of observations that you've seen. 

Interviewee: Well, there's a lot more traffic in this area than there was before, and there's a lot more residential building. Housing sprawl has spread widely and gone further and further into closer to North Carolina, into an area that was called the Green Zone. And there's more and more development of single-family homes especially, and lots more apartment complexes. So, the urban sprawl or the suburban sprawl has been huge in this area. There's been development of shopping centers, large shopping centers in the area. So, just very quickly growing, overcoming, you know, of taking down natural resource areas and building more buildings.

Interviewer: Specifically, what kind of changes have you seen at the oceanfront and that the beachfront?

Interviewee: A lot more. The oceanfront was more small, single-family houses. A lot of the older houses are being taken down and are being replaced with two condominiums instead. So, the population rising around the beach is increasing significantly, and they've been tearing down some old hotels that had a lot of property around them, and they have built condominiums there. So, the population is really crowding around the beach front.

Interviewer: Okay. With all these infrastructural changes, have you noticed any changes in like, you know, the wildlife, what you can see at the beach? And what, you know, the kind of like the water quality and things you're allowed to do at the oceanfront?

Interviewee: Well, when we first got here, there were a couple of things you could do that you can't do anymore. One was, you could drive down the beach from Virginia down to North Carolina. They don't allow you to drive on the beach anymore unless you have a special permit. We used to be able to bike ride through one of the state parks. They don't allow you to do that anymore. Wildlife, we're seeing a lot of wildlife come out, like we've got coyote now down at the beach, and it's crossing...is coming out of our state park, and they're crossing across residential areas. I haven't seen too much in the way of bird life. When we first moved here, we didn't have pelicans, and pelicans have moved up the east coast and into our area. I've been seeing more dolphin in the middle of the winter, when you never used to see dolphin. They used to migrate out because the waters were too cold, and last January we saw dolphins frolicking in the water. So, a lot of the ocean life is moving closer to the shore because the water is warmer, and they're seeking more food even in the winter time.

Interviewer: Why do you think that, like, what do you think the effect of like people, like population moving, centering towards the oceanfront cost on that? Just [crosstalk 00:03:16] resources or...

Interviewee: Probably just the fact, that's probably just general climate change. One thing, the residents have had more effect on though with the dumping of nitrogen from the lawns and fertilizers, there's been an increase in warmth in the bay. We've had dying off of our oysters, and they're trying to...and increased growth of algae, and they're trying to reverse that if they can. So, the nitrogen flow from these residential homes that are fertilizing their lawns is making a big difference in changing the bay significantly. 

Interviewer: And so, is the water quality ever been so poor that you can't do some activities that you've been able to do in the past? 

Interviewee: Oh, absolutely. I mean every summer they'll close down the parts of the beach or bay because of bacterial content, and then miraculously it's opened up just before Labor Day when the tourists come. So, it makes me a little nervous about swimming in certain parts of the water at certain times of year. 

Interviewer: Got it, got it. And you spoke a bit about things that you used to be able to do in the past, activities. Is there anything else that has changed due to infrastructural increase in the past 20 years? 

Interviewee: Well, it makes it harder to do any kind of bicycle riding on the roads and things like that. They're trying to accommodate bicyclist by building bike trails, but there's a lot more traffic on the roads. Just trying to think what else there might be... 

Interviewer: And earlier you spoke about wildlife preservations in the area. Have those grown in the area? Decreased? They're about the same? 

Interviewee: Well, I would say that they've...some of it has grown because that lack of being able to bicycle right through that national or state park I was telling you about, was to protect migrating birds. So that was a step in the right direction, and they're trying to...the Chesapeake Bay Foundation is trying to revitalize the bay, because they know the bay has had a lot of trouble. So, there's lots of incentive. If you want to start seeding the bay by trying with small oysters and they'll, you know, they'll give you the oysters for free. So, they're trying hard to do that, but it's a battle against what's happening from the pollutants from all the people living here. 

Interviewer: Yeah. And is that mostly from people living there? Or bigger industries coming and adding to that effect? 

Interviewee: Well, I think that it's people living here and then industries up the Chesapeake Bay and then the water flows down. 

Interviewer: The run off coming down?

Interviewee: Yeah, because we don't have a lot of in...[inaudible 00:05:53]. We haven't had a growth in industry. Our industries are mostly the military and the tourist industry. I wouldn't say we have more factories or things like that. 

Interviewer: Great. Well, thank you for your time, and I think that concludes our interview.

Interviewee: I can think of...
