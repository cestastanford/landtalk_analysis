Tiffany: My name is Tiffany Alvarenga and I'm Interviewing Mario Alvarenga, and his 20 years in DC. So when you think of the first time you moved to Washington DC, like what do you remember?

Mario: So we used to live at 14th and Columbia Road. It used to be dirty. There was a lot of crime, there were a lot of gang members and the neighborhood was not well kept, basically. It was just dirty all over and it was not a safe neighborhood, but that's where we lived and we called it home. 

Tiffany: So when you say dirty, like what do you mean?

Mario: Dirty, I'm talking about a lot of trash on the streets. A lot of houses and apartment buildings not kept up to code. We can say not painted correctly. Paint peeling and cars were broken into and it was just plain dirty, period. 

Tiffany: So, what do you remember doing there? Or like, what was the hobbies there?

Mario: So there were not a lot of hobbies but back in the days, there were no cell phones, no computers, there were video games that just started coming out like Nintendo and we used to still have...I forgot the name of the video game. But anyway, there was Nintendo and Sega that were out back in the days. And we would spend some time playing video games, whichever friend had it basically, because it was kind of expensive. So not too many people had it back in the days. And whenever it was a nice beautiful day, we will play outside marbles, tag or even ride our bicycles around the neighborhood. And we used to have this alley where we would race basically, just run all over those places. It was a dead-end alley. So there were no cars basically in and out.

Tiffany: And just not for a game or for other people like what would you do in general, like other people as well? Any activities there.

Mario: There were not a whole lot of activities. I mean the closest park was the national zoo. That was the closest one. Other than that, it was just mainly buildings. There were no parks close by where you can just go and play, hang around...Or there was actually the Sacred Heart Church, there was a park there where you know, just once in a while, we would go there and just play around. There was like a soccer field as well, just played soccer as well. 

Tiffany: Yeah. So now think of like Washington DC today. Like what is different like any small changes or any big changes? 

Mario: There are big, big changes actually. One of the biggest changes is Metro King, so that area, which is Columbia Heights metro station. And they changed the whole scenery all over the neighborhood basically. So now all the streets looks so clean and bright. And there are a lot of restaurants, there are a lot of places where you can hang out. And they basically just change it all over and it's a totally different look basically. 

Tiffany: So like remember a place you spent like a lot of time there like 20 years ago. Like is it still there? 

Mario: Yeah, the Columbia Road, the alley we used to spend a lot of time just messing around. Now it is so different. People have upgraded their houses, kept up their lawns and it's just nice to be sitting in the backyard now in that area because it feels safe basically. 

Tiffany: So how's like the lifestyle different now?

Mario: Lifestyle down there is very, very, very expensive. Basically, back in 20 years ago it was mainly blacks and Hispanics living there, so I guess lifestyle was cheaper. Now it's...I'm not saying most but mainly a lot of white people are moving into that area and they are raising prices like crazy. Apartments where they used to rent for like $800, one-bedroom apartment now rent for like $1,800. So I will say it has double. So it's very expensive to live around that area now.

Tiffany: Has the amount of activities or like activities changed there?

Mario: Oh, yeah, they have a lot of activities around the neighborhood now. Especially once they re-modeled the Heights...No, what do you call that school? Bell Multicultural High School and they joined it together with Lincoln. Basically, they fixed the park. They used to call the park "La Polvosa," now it's like all greenery. The name doesn't even go with it no more. 

Tiffany: What does that mean? 

Mario: La polvosa?

Tiffany: In English. 

Mario: In English, It means the...Huh? That's a good question. La polvosa is like... Oh, my God. It's a field where you have no grass. It's all dirt. That's what it means basically. It's all dirt. And whenever you played soccer I was like, all this dust just flying around. That's how I used to be. And now they also where Bell used to be at, they made it like an artificial soccer field. So they have a lot of games there between schools, between groups basically that play soccer. And it's just a different scenery from like 20 years ago. 

Tiffany: Is there anything that stayed the same? 

Mario: There are some buildings that have been under construction for many years and especially one right behind Sacred Heart School on Heights Place where it has been under construction. I will say about 12, 15 years already. And that's one of the old buildings that make the area look kind of bad we can say. But other than that, I mean a lot has changed. Even restaurant owners. Restaurant owners, business owners, they have changed, so.

Tiffany: So, like how have they changed? Has the food changed or?

Mario: Yeah. A lot of Vietnamese restaurants. A lot of...I don't want to say this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. It's become more Americanized the restaurants around that area. And there's still a couple of Spanish restaurants, but a lot of people have basically moved out and other owners have moved in basically opening up new businesses. 

Tiffany: Is there anything else you'd like to mention? 

Mario: No. Nothing in particular. 

Tiffany: All right, thank you. 

Mario: Thank you.
