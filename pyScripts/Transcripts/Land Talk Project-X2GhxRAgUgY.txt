Interviewer: Okay. So we're talking about Columbia, Maryland and the way the landscape has changed. So how did the place used to look like 20 years ago?

Man: Shall we say, "I don't know?"

Woman: It used to look...I don't know how to describe it. I mean, that it's just less apartment buildings that... The mall was smaller, fewer, much less...like a restaurant. There was a food court in there, but in the mall, there were not many restaurants. There was...

Interviewer: Was there more, like, nature, or...

Woman: More...

Man: Nature.

Woman: More nature, yeah.

Interviewer: Like, would you say that the same is true of, like, all of Columbia? Like, there's just more development now?

Woman: Absolutely. Over the 20 years, there were so many more developments, commercial and residential. And even for senior...like a communities. There's more senior communities. 

Man: Yeah.

Woman: And around the mall, there is more apartment...higher-priced apartments.

Interviewer: Right. Yeah. They have really seemed to expand, like, the commercial part of the mall and where it reaches now.

Woman: Yeah. 

Man: Yeah.

Woman: Definitely.

Man: There wasn't the AMC Theatre. AMC Theatre is probably only about 10 year old. I mean...

Woman: That's right. The movie theater wasn't there. The bank, there was more bank there, too. 

Man: The reason is that in general, Howard County is expanding because of the established...of Homeland Security and NHA. They moved a lot of [inaudible 00:02:22] in East Howard County and Acropolis. Well, the population grew so large, and at the [inaudible 00:02:32], the central part of our county, to accommodate the population growth. They grew a lot, and a lot of young people don't want to live in that area because they want the two minutes walkability. That's why those...these high-end apartment buildings and condos are up there.

Woman: We have condos, too.

Interviewer: Has Merriweather changed a lot, do you think? Like...

Woman: Yeah. They're extending...like a Toby's Dinner Theatre. They'll take it down, and then they're moving out to a more...towards in the center, in the woods.

Interviewer: And they're building a lot of those new parking garages...

Woman: [inaudible 00:03:19] 

Interviewer: ...and there's a steakhouse.

Woman: ...parking garages, restaurants, and a theater. 

Man: [inaudible 00:03:24]

Woman: Yeah, office buildings.

Man: It's expanding [inaudible 00:03:27], medical [inaudible 00:03:28].

Woman: Oh. I think also medical hospitals expanded, too.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Woman: Yeah.

Interviewer: So what are some of the things that you used to do there, like, 20 years ago?

Woman: Like, I used to take Morgan and you, like, a go for like... Like we'd go into this park and like a... Do you remember, we'd do the geo whatever?

Interviewer: Geocaching?

Woman: Geocaching.

Interviewer: Yes.

Woman: And Morgan used to go, like, have... Was it Cub Scout? No, that was in Connecticut. Morgan used to go play, like, in the park, recreation...

Man: [inaudible 00:04:22] is you shopped...and restaurant. That's the most...

Interviewer: So, would you say it, like... What do you think that you do there now that's different or that you didn't do 20 years ago?

Woman: We'd go to the mall for the restaurants more than we used to go because there weren't...

Man: The mall [inaudible 00:04:49].

Woman: ...weren't, like, restaurants, right? 

Man: Yeah.

Woman: Only like a food court. And then movie theater, 20 years ago, wasn't there. We didn't go. We now go there. And then there is like a... Hospitals, 20 years ago, I think a Howard County General Hospital was much smaller. Now, it's partnered with Hopkins...Johns Hopkins medical school and center. I think it's just much bigger. More things can be done there.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Man: The amphitheater.

Woman: And then lakefront, I mean, we go there much more often nowadays than before. Before they crammed it, there weren't that many restaurants. It was pretty...like a...kinda quiet. Now, it's much more traffics and different kind of restaurants than 20 years ago.

Interviewer: Yeah. And they put that Whole Foods in. 

Woman: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And there's a Wegman. Wegman? Is that how you...

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. A Wegmans.

Woman: Wegmans wasn't there 20 years ago.

Man: We don't go to the library.

Interviewer: You don't go to the...

Woman: Oh, well, because you're not... You guys get out of the house, and we don't go to the library anymore. That's true.

Interviewer: Yeah. But we used to go all the time.

Woman: Oh, we used to go there all the time. You used to check out 30...at least 30 books. And everyone's, like, "I can't..." You read it so fast. It's like, oh gosh, you have so many books.

Interviewer: Okay. I think we're good.
