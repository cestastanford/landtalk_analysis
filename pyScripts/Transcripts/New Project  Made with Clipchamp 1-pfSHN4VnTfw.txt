Tanzania: Hello. My name is Tanzania Jones, and I attend the [inaudible 00:00:04] School. I did my Land Talk with my teacher, Ms. Smith on 1548 Poplar Avenue Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America. What purpose was the building serving 20 years ago and what purpose does it serve today?

Ms. Smith: So, 20 years ago, 1548 Poplar was used by the Memphis Leadership Foundation. The Memphis leadership Foundation was founded by Dr. Larry Lloyd, and in that building was several ministries that ministered to the marginalized and the disenfranchised people of Memphis and Shelby County. So there were ministries there like Streets Ministries, Neighborhood Housing Opportunities, Urban Youth Initiative, Victims to Victory, Multinational Ministries. There were many ministries there that were serving different families and different people in the community. Question two.

Tanzania: How has the purpose contribute to the growth and advancement of the city?

Ms. Smith: I believe that the Memphis Leadership Foundation contributed to the growth of the city by ministering to the people who were marginalized, the people who were coming here from different countries, coming in through multinational ministries, that did not have an opportunity to be ministered to or to learn about Christ.

And multinational ministries did tutoring, they did all types of things to help people acclimate to the city. Victims to Victory is a ministry that ministered to people who had experienced victimization through death. Urban Youth Initiative was a ministry that ministered to the youth throughout the city that were considered urban youth, or inner-city youth. So the ministry and the building as a whole played a major part in the growth of different families in the community. Question number three.

Tanzania: Are there any historical memories about these locations?

Ms. Smith: I believe there are, and I'm not exactly sure, and you're gonna have to research this part. But that land used to be land that was owned by a lady who used to kidnap children, and like kill children there. It was something crazy before Memphis Leadership Foundation bought the building. So I think it's something that you may have to research. But it's in the article I sent you.

Question number four. How was the place when I grew up as a child? Honestly, when I grew up as a child, I'm not familiar with what was happening during that time. But I will say this, when my children were growing up, when I initially became connected to Memphis Leadership Foundation, my children were 12, 8, and 3. And as a result of Urban Youth Initiative, which was the ministry that was housed at that location, my children were exposed to youth ministry. They were exposed to different activities. They were introduced to Christ, and they just were allowed to experience a number of different ministries, a number of different opportunities. They were able to go to Kids Across America. So Memphis Leadership Foundation contributed majorly to the growth and advancement of the lives of my children. Question five.

Tanzania: What changed over the years? Like owners, or the building structures, or the different types of programs?

Ms. Smith: Well, one thing that changed over the years is some of the ministries moved out and moved into different locations. One of the ministries that moved out is the ministry called Streets Ministries. Another ministry that was housed in that building, and I think over the years they moved out as well, is a ministry called Economic Opportunity. And that particular ministry ministered to the lives of those that have been incarcerated. And they offered a training program and advancement and placement for them.

So a lot of the ministries moved out into different buildings, while another ministry moved in called, oh gosh, Memphis Centre for Urban Theological Studies. They actually moved in and occupied over 50% of the building. Since that time, everybody has moved out and the building has been sold. Question six.

Tanzania Jones: What was the owner's inspiration?

Ms. Smith: The owner's inspiration, which was Dr. Larry Lloyd, I believe his inspiration for founding Memphis Leadership Foundation came out of his experience with young life. He's always been community-minded. He's always had a love for the city. And I believe that Memphis Leadership Foundation was birthed out of his love and passion for inner city, and for God's word and the opportunity to spread that word abroad.

Tanzania: Okay, we're done.

Ms. Smith: That concludes our interview. Thank you.
