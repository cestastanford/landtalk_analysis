Interviewer: Hey, Tim?

Tim: Is that any better?

Interviewer: Yeah, sounds good. 

Tim: Okay.

Interviewer: Yeah. So we're just talking about The Old Place next to Cornell.  And yeah, the first question is how did this place look before? 

Interviewer: Yeah. So, when we started building the business back up in 2009, most of the changes were just to infrastructure. So, you know, the aesthetics were something that we wanted to kind of freeze in time and, you know, the success I think really, you know, really counted on that. So again, it was just really the systems and how we were going to operate that was the overhaul. 

Interviewer: What were some of the physical changes that kind of took place from the outside?

Tim: Really it was cleaning up. We decided to go ahead and hump some of the outcrop buildings because we knew that the building was, you know, so tiny we can only take so many people in there. But we wanted the people that were waiting to be able to kinda wander around, more of like a Disneyland. But with hand-painted signs and, you know, little trinkets and novelty items were the things were going to keep you entertained while you're waiting for your seat at The Old Place. 

Interviewer: Yeah. You know, I was looking at some of the original pictures and it was, like, bare. There was no buildings around it. So, I guess, what are some things that you used to do here?

Tim: What I used to do when running the restaurant?

Interviewer: I mean, I don't know, just when you were in that area? I mean, I don't know, you can answer this however you'd like really.

Tim: Okay. Well, I mean, things that really kind of, you know, drew me to the area was the fact that we're just, you know, there's 11, 9 people in our back door and you feel like you've escaped Los Angeles. So the fact that, you know, we are a destination location, you know, we're pulling people from, you know, halfway across Los Angeles County, if not all the way, and down into Orange County. And so, you know, my fascination was with the history is still intact, how are people going to connect with that? And so, you know, let's kind of enhance it wherever we can.

And so it really became, you know, storytelling and, you know, we had Tom Runyon who was the patriarch of the family and still running the business. So I was lucky enough to have three years while he was...you know, I was involved with Cornell and he was still alive. And so he was able to kind of pass on these, you know, true-life stories that, I mean, honestly, you would sit back and go, "No he just made that up. There's no way someone lived that life."

And that's something that's, you know, emblazoned onto, you know, the logo, the look of The Old Place. You know, it's like a Western saloon. You know, and that was by design by Tom. So there's no way I would've wanted to polish that up too much. We did make it more enticing in the sense that there used to be [inaudible 00:03:09] like chicken wire, you know, on the windows. And they had all these different colored... It was wild. They had all this, like, colored glass, you couldn't see through it.

The whole idea was that so you couldn't see through it and, you know, and not see what was going on in there. And that was the first thing we did is pull all of that off. So if you're standing outside you could look in and see the bar, you could, you know, see some of the charm. And, you know, we're only open Thursday through Sunday, though people come there Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and are walking around the property, carrying through things, it's pretty cool.

Interviewer: Yeah. So my last question then is what are some of the things you do here now, like till 2017?

Tim: Now it's been as responsive as we possibly can to the business at hand. You know, now, I mean obviously, it's some narrative to have such growth over such a short period of time. And so now it's really just, you know, customer service, customer service, you know, engaging people, sharing with them, you know, our story and making sure that we're connecting the dots with our storyteller on what we're doing here, just a wine shop. But we're a wine shop connected to a story, we're a restaurant connected to a story, and that gives us that depth. 

You know, something to play on. You know, honestly, it's like I'm in the negotiations with Troutdale right now and, you know, and I love it. I mean, it's the Clayco family that started Troutdale. It's the Rummien family that started The Old Place. Nothing to do with Tim. You know. Tim came in and was able to identify, you know, a unique charm and then, basically, we were able to, you know, adopt that history. So, am I part of the story? Absolutely. But there's a long story before you even get to me. And the same thing with Troutdale, we're going to call it, you know, Clayco families Troutdale. [inaudible 00:05:15] Troutdale. I mean, I didn't start this. 

You know, and it behooves me to, you know, adopt their history and make it my own. And that's kind of been the theme with The Old Place and, yeah, with Cornell. I called it Cornell winery, which is the historic name of the town, you know, Ezra Cornell, who, you know, with the stroke of his pen signing stuff out there and named the whole town across the country he had never been to. 

Interviewer: Wow, that's funny. Nice, I like that, you know, keeping the historical aspect alive. Well, thank you so much for your time. I'm going to stop recording now.

Tim: Are you all situated in your place [inaudible 00:06:01]?

Interviewer: Yeah, you know, I'm finally moved in.
