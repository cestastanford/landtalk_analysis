Interviewer: Okay. First question. How did the like, house and like, the landscape around it used to look?

Interviewee: Well, the trees were much younger, so they was much smaller, as you can see from the pictures. They were still very young trees. And they were tied to the house because they were not growing well. But then after 20 years they've grown quite big. It creates a nice shade now. And the landscape, we used to have bigger flower beds. But now it's up to close to the house. We used to have a lot of annual flowers in flower beds. But it's gotten to the point that it was just too big for us to manage well. So every [inaudible 00:01:04] years, so we started to make it a little bit smaller. And also the driveway. We have a swing-in garage. We wanted to create a larger driveway, so we cut parts of the flower bed and we put concrete so that we can use that space to drive into the garage a little bit more comfortably I guess.

Interviewer: Okay. And so like, what are things that you used to do there, and what are some things that like you kind of do now, like in contrast?

Interviewee: Well, I mean, when the kids were small, we used to have parties in the front. We would have like, I don't know if you remember Slip and Slide, we would have that. And our kids, the neighbors used to be a little bit, you know, they were more closer, you know, their kids are closer in age. So we used to, all of us used to come to the front yard and then have conversations. And we used to have neighborhood parties. We used to have neighborhood garage sales. We used to have a homeowners club. You know, we had, I guess that when there was a threat of a building being built behind the fence, we would always get together and have a meeting to talk to the city council and zoning committee to you know turn down that application, stuff like that. I guess there is a, what is it, building across the street. We have a storage place moving in, so I guess it just didn't work out this time. But we're not that close anymore, because we have had so many changes. I guess in the last three or four years, we've had so many neighbors moving, so we're not as close as we used to be.

Interviewer: Okay. And like, is there like, what are things that you do in the front now? Like, you mentioned that, like, you do sometimes more individual projects, like washing cars, and doing lawn stuff. Right?

Interviewee: Yeah. Just individually. I mean some neighbors work on the...you know, we fix the flower beds and entryways. And I think individually, people are working on that. You know, some people want to fix the fences. I mean on the typical weekend we have yard work and washing cars, and you know, whatnot. I don't see many garage sales here anymore. I mean, they used to have it, but I don't think they do that anymore.

Interviewer: Okay. Thanks for like answering my questions. I really appreciate it.
