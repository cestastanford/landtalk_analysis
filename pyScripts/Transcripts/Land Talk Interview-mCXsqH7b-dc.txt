Karina: Okay. My name is Karina Martinez. I'm a student at Northwestern High School. And I'm going to be interviewing you with a couple of questions regarding the general area you've lived in for at least 20 years. Can you start by introducing yourself?

Jogli: My name is Jogli Martinez.

Karina: How old are you, Jogli?

Jogli: I'm 43 years old.

Karina: How long would you say you've lived in this general area?

Jogli: Approximately 16, 17 years.

Karina: 17 years? Okay. I'm going to start off by asking you what you remember first about when you moved here.

Jogli: Oh, I remember it was a quiet area, peaceful and not many business around.

Karina: So, would you say that's the general change that's been the most obvious in this area?

Jogli: The development of business.

Karina: That's what you say is the most thing that's changed in this area?

Jogli: Yes. And also it's become an area not that quiet like it you used to be.

Karina: Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?

Jogli: The area has been through a lot of changes, especially with the people that are moving into the area. Not quite like he used to be. A lot of people to have moved in, it's like they like party, they like to party every weekends around here. And for a person who's used to a peacefully and quiet time, it has been one of the most challenging areas for me now to adapt.

Karina: So, what would you say are some ways you've had to adapt to this unsettling silence that you've had to deal with?

Jogli: Oh, it all depends. I mean, people have a tendency to evolve with the situations. Well, I grew my family here, so I kind of started adapting to the changes that is going through.

Karina: So what would you say, aside from not being able to have as much silence as you used to before, what would you say is your favorite part about living here?

Jogli: Well, now my favorite part has become the development of business, stores, restaurants, accessibility to metro now.

Karina: Can you give me an example of the businesses or the stores that you say have developed here over time?

Jogli: Well, one of the biggest stores that is impacting the area is the Costco, Lowe's, stores that we needed to drive far away in order to get to it. But now we have them like just a few minutes away from it, from this area. And restaurants that we didn't have before, so.

Karina: So would you say that line of stores, those line of stores you visit frequently or often?

Jogli: Yes.

Karina: Can you tell me why?

Jogli: Well, are stores that basically have good deals most of the time, good prices. Since they're big stores, well, it's hard to small store to compete with them, so they have the chances better than any other store to give you better prices on basic products.

Karina: So aside from those changes in your general area, can you think of any recent changes that have happened in like say your neighborhood or any place around where you live?

Jogli: Meaning?

Karina: Like a drastic change. You can't think of one?

Jogli: Like I said, one...Well, I will say one of the drastic changes in this area, well, are people living around it. Like I said, it used to be a quiet area, but now there's more people living in this area, more houses development. And not only that, I will say probably you can see more people living in the area.

Karina: People who are not generally used to being quiet?

Jogli: Correct. Well, actually those are the people who make it now the area different. It's not that I'm against that because like I said before, I believe that I have adapted now to what the area is now. It's not that I'm really, really comfortable with, but I have adapted myself to the way the area is now.

Karina: Okay. So aside from all of that, what would you say would be the thing you miss most about living here 20 years ago?

Jogli: Oh, like I said, the peacefulness, quiet, more relaxed, not many houses around, not many stores, of course. I would say less a stressful area before.

Karina: So, would you, since I hear you repeatedly say over and over again about how it used to be more quiet in this area, would you say that the silence is something that's important to you?

Jogli: Well, a quiet area is an area in which you probably will have a better rest. You will, and I will say the way I think is, people will enjoy you more for a quiet person, for somebody who likes peacefulness and not many noise around? Yes. That was one of the biggest impact in this area now

Karina: And one that you find important to you?

Jogli: Yes.

Karina: So what would you say is something you like most about living in this area?

Jogli: Now something that I like most in this area is the development of business, the stores, and restaurant.

Karina: Would you say that's the only development you can think of?

Jogli: Accessibility to metro including.

Karina: Transportation?

Jogli: Transportation.

Karina: Do you use the transportation often?

Jogli: Every now and then.

Karina: You use it every now and then? For what purposes?

Jogli: Work.

Karina: Work?

Jogli: Yes.

Karina: So would you say the new transportation, like the new availability to like closer businesses, would you say that's helped you in your everyday life?

Jogli: I would say yes. Every area that has improved with accessibility to metro transportation, buses, it definitely it will make a big impact in a positive way.

Karina: In a positive way. So, aside from the negativity of not having the quiet neighborhood...

Jogli: The quiet peacefulness.

Karina: ...that you prefer, the positivity of the transportation and new businesses...

Jogli: Compensate that, yes.

Jogli: ...outweigh the negativity. Is there anything else you would like to add to any of this?

Jogli: No, unless you have other questions.

Karina: No, those are all my questions. Thank you for your time and for allowing me to interview you. That's all I have to say.
