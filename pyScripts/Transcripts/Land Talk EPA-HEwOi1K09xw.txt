Interviewer: Hi, I'm here with my mom, Andrea. And, you want to introduce how long have you been here and what area we're talking about it?

Andrea: So, I've been in the area since '93, in Menlo Park specifically since 1995, but the area we're talking about is the interchange on 101 at the University Avenue.

Interviewer: And how would you say it's changed over time since you got here to what it's sort of like today?

Andrea: Well, the biggest change is probably when we first got here, the exit off of 101 heading West on the University towards Stanford was all like really rundown liquor stores and there were homeless people sleeping on the streets and it was just a lot of trash, a lot of rundown buildings. And then that at some point got all swept away and turned into a big office complex and hotel. It's now the Four Seasons. Actually, when it first went in, they printed all their letterhead the Four Seasons prints this as being in Palo Alto. And there was a big uproar because it's actually technically in East Palo Alto. But it was kind of considered to be too snobby that they put there the wrong city on the letterhead.

It completely changed the character because there's this gleaming upscale. It has restaurants and offices and they changed the whole exit, so you don't need to even go through that spot anymore to get off the freeway. And I guess it was kind of the end of this period of time when East Palo Alto was very crime-ridden. And, when we moved here, people would talk about how they used to hear shots in our neighborhood from, you know, gang activity over in East Palo Alto, East Menlo Park. And I think that had all ended before we moved here. But there were still some things like that that made it seem like a more troubled area than it is now. And then for a long time it was just a stable working-class area and now it's getting gentrified too.

The other things that have changed around there...they added that whole Gateway 101. That was probably before the hotel went in. And then later, the IKEA got added in there. So, it's like this whole retail hub, which changed the tax base significantly for East Palo Alto.

Interviewer: Yeah. I don't know how you interact with that area? Has that changed a lot?

Andrea: How what...interact with the area?

Interviewer: Or like what you do there. How is your interaction with the area?

Andrea: Yeah, I never went over there. I don't even know what it looked like before they built that Gateway 101. I don't have any memory of what was there. I know it used to be a high school, but I do remember when they opened that Home Depot because we used to have to go up to San Carlos to the Home Depot. And I remember that when we first started going to East Palo Alto one, it was like night and day. They were so much more helpful with the new one. People were just wonderful. And I do know that they made an effort to hire local people, so it was a job opportunity as well as enhancements to the tax base to put in all those businesses. They hired a lot of local people.

Interviewer: I mean, from my more recent memory, I, of course, was pretty young when this all started, it seems like it's sort of been accelerating recently. Would you agree with that?

Andrea: Yeah, it's been spreading. In other parts of East Menlo Park, East Palo Alto, there have been new businesses going in and new buildings going in. And, I know that there's been a lot of pressure on the rental housing market that people are trying to raise the rents or build bigger, newer buildings in place of what was there in order to capitalize on the increase in property values.

Interviewer: All right. Well, thank you for taking part in this interview.

Andrea: You're very welcome.
