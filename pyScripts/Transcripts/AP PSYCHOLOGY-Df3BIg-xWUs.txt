Kumar: Hello, this is Kumar Mills, and I'm interviewing somebody today who has lived in the same home for over 20 years. Today, I'm going to ask her about some questions. So, when do you remember when you first moved here?

Interviewee: I was an infant, so, I don't have any memory of moving into the home. I lived here all my life, in the same city.

Kumar: What are some things that you have seen that's changed from when you were little till now?

Interviewee: One is the demographics. So, growing up the demographic was primarily African-American, and Hispanic, and then also, there was a large immigration population from Africa, or the Caribbean. But now it's starting to become mixed. Well, the Hispanic population is increasing more, but I'm also seeing more Caucasians moving in. And I think that's attributed to, one, there's college units that have been built recently, within the past 10 years. And they are definitely upgrading parts of the city. And the purple line is also running through the city, which I think is also bringing in more people, or a different demographic.

Kumar: What's your favorite part about living here?

Interviewee: I enjoy the fact that I live somewhere in the suburbs. So, I live just outside of Washington DC, so, it's not too hard to get to DC and enjoy the city life. And then when I want to retreat, I just come home. And it's just a familiarity. So, I'm just very comfortable here.

Kumar: Have you seen any animals here?

Interviewee: Yes, definitely. Depending on the time of the day, you'll see deer. Well, actually, I remember waking up some mornings and there'll be a family of deer in my neighbor's front yard. What else? I've seen a possum. I believe I've seen a fox in the neighborhood. There's also some stray cats and some beautiful birds.

Kumar: How has the weather changed from then till now?

Interviewee: Much more unpredictable. A lot more rain, I would say, and threats of tornadoes. For example, this year alone, this has been... I guess I would say a milder spring. Usually, by the time we hit May it's very hot and very humid. And so, spring has actually lasted longer than it normally does, like you'll feel the summer heat by this time. We're in June now actually, so, well, you know, right now we'll be experiencing heat waves, and we haven't experienced that this year. Yeah, I just want to say moreso the unpredictability of it, like, it has become more unpredictable than the past

Kumar: Have you liked your environment more when you were little or now?

Interviewee: Well, it's changed. So, when I was little I definitely appreciated it and enjoyed it. But now it's changed, and due to the change in demographic there's different things that are here, like different stores that are opening and thriving. And so, I can appreciate those new things. But it's still sometimes because of the change in demographic, I sometimes feel like a stranger in my own city, like, it's weird. I come or I drive through and I'm like, it's different. And so, is an adjustment that I have to go through.

Kumar: Thank you for your time.

Interviewee: You're welcome.
