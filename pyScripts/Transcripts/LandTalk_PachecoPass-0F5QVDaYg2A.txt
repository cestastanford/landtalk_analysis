Interviewer: Hey, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me today. I just wanted to get your input on, given that you've been living in California for over 25 years, how you've seen the landscape change, and, yeah. So, how long have you lived in California?

Interviewee: 35 years.

Interviewer: And why did you immigrate to the State?

Interviewee: The State is rich in culture, and it has a varied aspect of the economy that's vibrant in the area, and especially, I was attracted towards the Silicon Valley. So I've been living in Silicon Valley almost 35 years.

Interviewer: Nice. And so, which part of the state would you say you have frequented the most?

Interviewee: I lived in the Bay Area, but I've been travelling to Sacramento, Bakersfield, Fresno, LA, Kern County areas a lot of time for business and for frequent travels.

Interviewer: And you've continued those travels over the years or how do…?

Interviewee: Yeah. I have travelled regularly over the last 25 years, driving through these areas all the time.

Interviewer: Nice. So, in terms of the landscape near Fresno and the Bakersfield area, you generally pass through Pacheco Pass, which is a historic area and the surrounding reservoir. Can you talk about how that looked 20 years ago?

Interviewee: The flora and fauna in that area has dramatically changed over the period of last 25 years. It's been really interesting to see how the area has changed. When we used to drive almost, what, 15, 20 years ago, the areas used to become green and the hills around become…were [inaudible 00:02:06] lush with trees and shrubs all sprouting, starting from November going all the way to March. And recently, I've been observing, when I have been travelling even through the months of December, January, the hills and the areas around it remain dry, and I can still see the brown thorny bushes around them.

The reservoir which used to become full by January up to the brim, and sometimes there used to be an overflow, so there used to be a small overflow catchment area on the other side of the road which also used to get full. What this used to do is, the streams that were feeding into the lake were always filled with water. It used to attract a different kind of fauna to the area. All kinds of different birds used to flock the reservoir and small rivulets and streams that were flowing into the lake. I have noticed that while driving nowadays, the surrounding area seems to be dry and not much activity going on, either in the terms of any wildlife visiting the area, or different kind of flowers sprouting during the spring season.

Interviewer: Got it. And you mentioned the water levels. So how do you know that the water levels are not reaching what they used to?

Interviewee: You know, the water level used to be almost up to the brim, and nowadays when we visit, we can see the water level down because the craters of water level used to be way up when we used to stop, and where the water level is down now. And one interesting thing is to always notice this, because we used to always stop our car. It was on full moon days. We could see the moon just sitting on the top of the lake surface. And almost it was like the moon was right on top of it on the lake. Now, on full moon days since the water level is so down, that sight has vanished.

Interviewer: Got it. And have you noticed anything in terms of like the temperature? Is it more drier during the summer, or any temp like…?

Interviewee: The temperature definitely has changed. It's drier now, and it's much more…during the winter times, it's very kind of dry weather in terms of the chill factor and the temperature is totally different now.

Interviewer: Got you. So you mentioned that you used to like stop at visitor points. Was there anything else you used to do in the surrounding areas?

Interviewee: Yeah, we used to sometimes hike around the state parks that is surrounding the Pacheco Park area and the recreational area that's around the lake where it's sometimes adjacent to the lake, to the Pacheco Pass. There is a lake which catches the back end of the water where we used to go fishing and boating, which was different previously. Now that has changed too.

Interviewer: Got it. So when you go over there now, do you mainly just stop at visitor points or what?

Interviewee: Nowadays I just stop at the visitor point and just a part of observations is that has been an iconic area. Always stop there and look at the surroundings and pass by for a few minutes.

Interviewer: Got it. Thank you so much for your time. This was super helpful. Yeah, I really appreciate it.

Interviewee: Thank you.
