Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. So, can you tell me, like, how this place used to look?

Interviewee: How what?

Interviewee: This is hutong. It's all one [inaudible 00:00:16].

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. So, it was not very...so, were there a lot of tall buildings nearby?

Interviewee: No. No, no. No tall buildings actually.

Interviewer: So what was the tallest building nearby?

Interviewee: The tallest building is the research center. It's about 3 floors tall.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm, and what research center was this?

Interviewee: Plastic.

Interviewer: Oh, I see, plastic manufacturers.

Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a research center. 

Interviewer: Okay, plastic research center. And so were there any parks nearby?

Interviewee: Yeah, there is a park. It's a community park. It's very small but it has some small hills and a small lake, something like that, and some tracks.

Interviewer: Okay. So, how has this place changed over the last 20 years?

Interviewer: Okay, and so how tall would you say is the tallest building now? And maybe a couple hundred meters near where you live.

Interviewee: Oh, okay. Because it is in the city, so it's about 5 to 6 floors tall.

Interviewer: Okay, mm-hmm. And have there been more, like...were there a lot of hotels or, like, stuff for tourists in the past maybe 20 years ago?

Interviewee: Yes, yes, yes. A lot because, around my house, there's a lot of interest place, so a lot of travelers and some [inaudible 00:02:14] hotel.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. And nowadays are there more hotels than there used to be in the past?

Interviewee: Of course, of course. 

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. Okay, and so what are some things you used to do near your house?

Interviewee: Oh, just play around, play with the insects, and catching games.

Interviewer: Is there still as much space to play nowadays?

Interviewee: Oh, no, no, no. Now kids just play computer games, I think. They have some sports equipment which we've never seen in my age.

Interviewer: And, do they do some things...are there new facilities for them to play that there weren't in the past? Like, maybe like a fancy playground or...I don't know. Like, what do kids...?

Interviewee: Yes, yes, yes, yes. They have some fancy playground. Yeah, yeah.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm, okay. So, what is an example...how is it fancy? [crosstalk 00:03:24] 20 years ago?

Interviewee: [crosstalk 00:03:25] seesaw. They have seesaw, and they have sliders, things like that. In my days, they don't have that kind of thing. We don't get that kind of facilities easily.

Interviewer: So, the communists weren't too nice about playgrounds for children 20 years ago?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Okay. 

Interviewee: Of course.

Interviewer: Okay. Okay, just give me a second. But you are 30, 40 years old about 20 years ago, so what else did you do nearby? Did you go clubbing or partying, or were there not a lot of bars nearby? Because there are a lot now, right?

Interviewee: Yes, only a few disco halls, I think, and we like to play there. There are no bars but we have restaurants where we can drink and have some fancy food that are homecooked.

Interviewer: Okay. And so one last question, so how did the natural landscape change? Do you think there are more trees/less trees, more grass/less grass? Does the area look healthier, dirtier, less healthy? What do you think?

Interviewee: You mean in my...

Interviewer: In your neighbhorhood.

Interviewee: My neighbhorhood?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: Yes, there are some trees and, yeah, it's a bit. Now it's getting better and better. They gave the community a facelift. So it now looks more interesting, more nice, more neat.

Interviewer: And was it very dirty years ago like no trees, nothing much natural?

Interviewee: Yes, yes. That's all?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: Okay. Okay, then I send two pictures. One present, one in the past, all right?

Interviewer: Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much.
