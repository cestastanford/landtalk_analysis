Together: Thank you for sharing with us today.

Female: Well, Las Lomitas school, when I started teaching here in 1988, used to look much smaller. Some of the buildings were here, but the big two-storey building that your classroom is in, and the library building were not even built back then. So, it has changed in the number of buildings that are here. The way it looks like now is that it's growing even larger. There are construction trucks, and buildings going up, and pretty soon you're gonna even have more new buildings, and then all the portable buildings on your classroom will be gone. The school has grown a lot, from about 300 students to over 500 students. So, it needs to change how it looks in order to make room for you to all fit into your classrooms.
