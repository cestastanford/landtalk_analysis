Jasmine: Hello, my name is Jasmine King, and today I'll be interviewing a past resident that has lived in Washington DC for about 20 years. Would you like to state your name or remain anonymous?

Interviewee: I prefer to remain anonymous. Thank you.

Jasmine: No problem. Now, Washington DC, what did it use to look like back in the day?

Interviewee: Well, I've only known DC itself since 1990, and that was the year that I first came to this country from Trinidad and Tobago. When I first got here, you know, my first reaction was, it was a beautiful city. I lived in the northwest quadrant of DC and it was full of community. Where I lived, it was, you know, a pretty busy area, as far as, you know, transportation was accessible, train stations were available, I was able to walk to school, even walk to work at times. So, it was quite accessible. So, that was a plus.

It was a sense of community, you know, folks looked out for each other. And, the great thing for me was that, you know, you had a lot of mom and pop stores, you know, on the corners. So, you know, that's where I would think the sense of community came from, everyone knew you either by face or recognition, and that's something that's, kind of, probably being lost today.

Jasmine: So, over those past 20 years, over time, how did Washington DC change?

Interviewee: It has changed physically, with a lot of old buildings being torn down and with new construction going up rapidly. There's probably not a dry lot anywhere to be seen, you know, nowadays, you have multi-level buildings that are going up with all the amenities, you know, that one can think of. And by that happening, it's, you know, forcing the original folks of the community that, you know, belong to the city, for a lack of a better term, be able to stay there, therefore, see them go further out, you know, to the outlying areas of DC. And then, what would you have coming in? You have coming in the more affluent people, which, you know, happen to be predominantly white folks coming into the city and residing and making a home there. So, in that instance, it has changed racially, as well as physically is what I would say, which is all part of gentrification as we know.

Jasmine: Is there any changes that you would say have a positive or negative effect on Washington DC?

Interviewee: Well, just piggybacking on the gentrification issue, it's negative in the sense that, you know, we're forcing the predominantly African American community to move out to outlying areas to, you know, survive because the rent is too high, the price of property to buy a house in DC is too high, it's just too much for even an average family to make it without, you know, being in a lot of debt. So, I would see that as being a negative impact. I don't think the city does enough to keep a balance of both, you know, both in the city black as well as white folks. So, it would be great if that, you know, increases in some instance.

And the positive effect is that by having, you know, folks occupy the city, even with the rent market being what it is, or the purchase market, the buyer's market, or purchase market being what it is, that it creates commerce, it creates, you know, revenue for the city, we're able to fix, you know, roads and infrastructure, you know, to better the areas. And that will always be a positive thing from the eyes of the government. But, you know, it disparages with, you know, thinking of the people, which it's who makes up the city, it's who makes the circle turn, you know, and so all the way. So, that's just my take on that.

Jasmine: With how Washington DC used to be, what activities did you do?

Interviewee: Well, back then, in the 90s, early 2000s, you know, I would have been that school-age person, you know, for a few years, but I pretty much worked. You know, I befriended a co-worker there and I pretty much hung out with her family at social as well as family events. So, that pretty much was my time. I really wasn't a, you know, traveler of sorts, so, I would, you know, spend my time, you know, just pretty much being low key. Movies were a great, you know, source of entertainment then, so, you know, still to this day for me, but not as much. But, that's where I kind of spent my time back then when I was younger.

Jasmine: Is there any activities that has changed over time?

Interviewee: Well, I would say that, since that time to now I've had a child, I've been married and divorced, and I've had to raise a child on my own. So, that has changed my perspective on, you know, my personal, you know, way of, you know, enjoying myself as one would say. I've decided to focus on making sure that my child has the best and, you know, she is, you know, doing well in her studies and has everything at her disposal. And if that meant, you know, me sacrificing for a few years, you know, my activities, as you would say it then and I'm okay with that. So, that's, kind of, how it has changed for me, and I'm okay with that. Yeah.

Jasmine: Well, okay. Thank you for your time.

Interviewee: No problem. Thank you.
