Interviewer: Okay, so I'm on the phone with my father, Carrey White. I'll let him introduce the building and the land we're talking about. Go ahead.

Interviewee: Okay. So the land on which our home is located was formerly, in the 1920s, was formerly a farm called Mortlod farm [SP]. And then in the 1920s it was developed as a garden suburb of Adelaide, and it was named after the person that designed the city of Adelaide, Colonel Light.

Interviewer: Great. Okay so, let's think back maybe 20 years ago, when you first moved into the house or whatever. Could you give us a general description of what the house and the land was like?

Interviewee: Okay. So the house at the time was a house built in the '20s, so when we moved into the house, it was already 60 years old. And it was a house of the 1920s, so it was relatively small. What attracted us was, it was a very large block, so, some 1200 square meters. And so when we looked at the house, there was a large distance between the [inaudible: 00:01:27] on either side. And also, at the rear of the house was a double tennis court which was available to the resident. 

Interviewer: Great. And so now, 20 years further down along the way, are there any significant changes in either the land, or the house, or the block itself which are worth noting?

Interviewee: So, what's happened, out of that period that the last 30 years which we've lived in the house, we've revamped the garden, and initially it was planted with a garden of Australian natives, because water is always an issue in Adelaide. But then, over time, we've redeveloped the land into a series of garden rows for different purposes. And also, with the house, because the needs of families has changed, we added a large family room to the property. And also added features, such as reverse cycle air-conditioning, and a sprinkler system to help maintain the block. 

Interviewer: Awesome. So, two more questions. One is, have you noticed any difference in the interaction of fauna, like local fauna, with our house or yard in particular, over those last 20 years?

Interviewee: Yeah. So, when we first went in, we planted a large gum tree, which is called a manna gum. And we chose that tree because it's quite a stable gum tree, quite safe for the children to play under. But what we didn't realize is that the manna gum is the staple food of the koala. So, over time we found that koalas magically turn up in our tree. And we only understand that they're there because we can hear the roaring in the night, or sometimes their droppings appear on the lawn, and we look up, see them sitting in the fork of the tree. And also quite an array of native birds are attracted to our garden, mainly because of the gum trees we have. And the most interesting of those are the white cockatoos, so they come down from the neighbor Adelaide hills, and descend upon the trees and feast on the flowers in the gum trees. 

Interviewer: Great. And so the last question is, just because Australia is obviously a unique country, and has been affected in recent years by climate change and global warming, etc. Is there anything you've noticed on the wider scale, not just on our block of land, but in Australia as a whole, which is either concerning or interesting, which may be result of either climate change or global warming?

Interviewee: Yeah. So, Australia has, even for the last 60,000 years, in which it's been habitated by the aborigines, it's always been an environment where fires are a natural part of the landscape. But in recent years, with the extreme temperatures, the incidents of bush fires has increased. So we all feel somewhat less secure now, because the hills aren't far away, and has been the experience in California, wild fires can soon move from natural areas into suburban areas. But generally, the main issue is water. So, having established these beautiful garden rows, which you can see in the photographs, there's an imperative about maintaining those. So, we've introduced drippers and sprinkler systems for the efficient application of water to keep those areas. We recently had the highest temperature in Adelaide, which was 47.8 degrees. That was the highest recorded temperature in Adelaide, so, that's the context of what we face in caring for the block of land on which our house sits. And also, keeping the inhabitants comfortable inside through air conditioning.

Interviewer: Great. Well, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. 

Interviewee: My pleasure.

interviewer: No worries.

Interviewee: Okay. Good luck with your work. Nice to speak.
