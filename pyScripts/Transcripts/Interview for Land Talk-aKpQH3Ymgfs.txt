George: Yeah, yeah. I was born in Shanghai and then we went to Hong Kong when I was 6 years old, so I was in Hong Kong for 5 years, till I was 11. And then we came from Hong Kong to California when I was 11, so that was back in 1957. It was a long time ago. Yeah, and so I was pretty much from then on in California, until I went to medical school. 

Well, the change would be probably more noticeable to me by... Well, I guess I could do either one, really. I was raised in Shanghai for five years when I was little. I don't recall a whole lot of it, but there were changes there that I certainly noticed when we did go back to Shanghai in the early 90s, 1990s, and so there were a lot of changes from that, you know, definitely, where the, you know, where China was much more polluted because they have, you know, more cars, more people.

Shanghai, when I was raised there, you know, there weren't that many tall buildings there, but when we did go back in 1990s, the skyscrapers were everywhere and all the skyscrapers aren't offices, they were all places where people lived. So a lot of people lived in skyscrapers, and that's the way they can get more people in a small area, you know, and... Because there's a lot of people that moved out of the farming country to the city like Shanghai, where they could make more money. 

And so, the consequence of that, you also saw a lot of pollution. I mean, the pollution was so bad there in the early 1990s that people had to actually call, you know, call out days in which you were supposed to not go outside and drive your car and that kind of thing. A lot of people I noticed there were wearing surgical masks, you know, like you do when you go into surgery, just to try to avoid all the pollution that goes on there.

But it was probably the worst I've ever seen in any other country. I mean, California has been well known to be somewhat polluted, but not compared to Shanghai. Shanghai was just really, really, really bad. And I think they're still pretty bad, although they're trying to do a lot of things to change things there by using less coal and doing better job of filtering the air and that kind of thing, but it's still bad just because of the number of people that live there

 I mean China has, like, ten times the population of the United States. You can imagine all the people there. They're all concentrated in one small area. The freeways are constantly, you know, backed up and you can imagine all the fumes and the things like that that goes on to the cars out to the space and creating the pollution problem so... 

But anyway, that's what I noticed was that, because of the increased people, increased technology and cars and the modern conveniences, the pollution got worse in Shanghai, for sure. And then when I was in California, I kind of noticed the opposite in that when I first moved there in 1957, when we came to California, there were pretty bad pollution days. California, you know, had busy freeways. I was in the L.A. area, near the L.A. area, and all the freeways are busy all the time.

They had no mass transit, you know, where you have good bus systems and good subway or rail systems that get people around, so everybody's on the own driving cars. And so things got really, really bad and there are days that... We kind of lived close to a mountain, kind of a mountain range. There were days that I couldn't see the mountain range, and then you literally couldn't see it from the smoke even [inaudible 00:04:45].

But that was Southern California and then we moved to Northern California, San Francisco area for, you know, some 30 odd years, and we still go back to California to visit because of, you know, the beach and things like that are much better in Southern California. And I noticed that those mountains, I could see them, you know, where I used to live in Southern California. I could see them on a regular basis every time I went down there.

So I think they made a lot of efforts to improve efficiency of the cars and, you know, to try to filter out the air through less car emissions and that kinda thing. Now also, probably, they changed the way that they use coal energy. I think they stopped doing a lot of that, too, which contributed to the pollution, so. So in California, I noticed was the opposite. They were polluted when I first moved there in 1957 but then through the years they got, you know, much better as far as containing the pollutions.

Ada:   Do you think it's definitely still a problem?

George: Oh, I definitely think it's still a problem, yeah, because, you know, as long as people have to drive, even though you reduce the amount of emissions in cars, and it's still going to continue to some degree, but it's certainly better than it used to be. And the United States, in general, have been much more conscious about, you know, other factors that create pollution, you know, from factories even to the spray can stuff. They outlawed the...I can't remember. It's the fluoride, I think it's the fluoro, carbon flow, something that gives the spray cans pressure. They've discovered that was a problem to environmental warming and all that and they outlawed that, so it changes [inaudible 00:06:51] been damaged to the environment, so they've done a lot to kinda change that. 

But as long as there's a lot of people living in a place, it's gonna be still a big problem. I think Southern California is still a big, big problem because their mass transit system is not quite as good as elsewhere because they just haven't been, you know, able to establish light rail systems and, you know, as far as bus systems and things that people now have in a lot of the cities that have started from scratch.

They would build them, but then, New York really avoided a lot of the problems by having the underground subway, because that moved a lot of people and got a lot of people off the roads and, so that's been very helpful. But, all of these places, you know, they'll continue to have problems until we figure out a way to not be able to pollute the air with their cars and things like that, you know. Hopefully, that'll be soon.

Ada:  What did you do in California compared, like, when you were younger, compared to what you do when you, like, visit there now?

George: Well, in California, you know, I used to run a lot. I was on the cross country and track teams and what not, during those early days when I first moved there. The pollution was bad enough that some days I really struggled running cross country, you know, whether it was training or races, I would actually have trouble breathing without coughing. I mean, it was like I had to take shorter breaths but I mean that's kinda changed now. I think the air is much easier to breathe now. I can't really remember any instances, you know, in recent times where running becomes a big problem.

Now, the problem with Salt Lake, I actually was living in the Utah Valley area where pollution is a really big problem, even though they solved a lot of it by eliminating some of the factories and steel mills and that kind of thing that were polluting the air with their chimneys and things like that. They still have a big problem just because the way the land is arranged, you know, where you have a big mountain range that kinda prevents air from moving around as much and so we kinda have a kind of a pollution problem.

And so we have days here still in Utah Valley where, you know, they say clean air warning days, where you're supposed to, you know, not barbecue and not use your wood stove and drive less, and that kind of thing. And they warn people who have health problems especially breathing problems to, you know, avoid going outside and that kind of thing. 

So it's still exists in Utah, and I don't know what it was like a long time ago, but I know that Utah, even though it does have its pollution days, is a lot clearer than it used to be. I mean it used to just, for the same thing, down in Provo, used to bring the kids up to school and visit them and that kind of thing in the Provo area and the pollution would be so bad all the time that you could not see the mountain behind the school and all that.

But now, you can see it most of the time except for those days where it gets what they call inversion, where the polluted air gets held into the atmosphere down low from high pressure. And it stays there for days, you know, and then it'll clear up again when it rain and wind coming through. But still, it's clearer than it used to be, you know, probably 30 years ago, tt was much worse.

Ada: Do you think there are any, like, weather changes from when you lived in California when you were younger to California now? Do you think the weather is different at all?

George: Yeah, I do and I think that's probably part of the thing that's created a lot of drought days in California. I mean, the weather change at UC, I don't remember such big swings of weather changes. I remember the first time I knew that it was a problem was when I went from L.A. when I was going to school and then, when I was going to medical school in St Louis, the weather seems to be pretty consistent, you know, year after year and what to expect. But when I first moved to California, Northern California near the Bay area, we had, I think, five years in a row of no rain.

I mean, literally, like in December, I would go out and it would be, like, 75 degrees in December and that would be all the whole winter long and then we wouldn't get much rain, and so we were having a lot of drought problems at that time. And then the rain would start and then things would get better and then we would have drought again for, you know, years, anywhere from three to five years and which then puts a lot of pressure on people trying to, you know, water their lawns and especially the farmers who were trying to grow fruit and vegetables out in the San Joaquin Valley. 

But we're still experiencing that, maybe somewhat even more than we used to be. I mean, Utah, here, we've had the drought problem for about six or seven years and a lot of the reservoirs are drying up and they were trying to institute some of the water controls through the population.

But, last year we had a really good year where it almost filled all the reservoirs back up again and they're expecting another good year this year. But the fact that dry years now can be strung together, you know, year after year, is kind of a problem really because you can't really plan very well, whether you're a farmer or whether you live in the area. It's hard to know, you know, what's going to happen the next year. Anyway, so if you think of anything else, don't hesitate to give me a call, okay?

Ada:  Okay. Thank you so much.

George: Okay, good luck on your stuff, okay, and we love you.

Ada:  Love you, too. Bye.

George: Okay. Bye, Ada

Ada: Bye.
