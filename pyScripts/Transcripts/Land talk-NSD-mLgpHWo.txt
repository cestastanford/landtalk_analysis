Kevin: Oh, I am Kevin Ventura and I'm here with Daisy Goavis and today we will have a land talk. For those who don't know what a land talk is, it is a conversation with someone about the past and present of a certain area that they lived in. Anything you'd like to tell me by yourself before we start this interview? 

Daisy: Yes, I am a 50-year-old woman that came from El Salvador, and I was born over there. But because of how life works, I had to find my way to the United States and look for a better future for me and my daughter. And when I first arrived here, I remember that my first job was at a Popeye's and I was still trying to understand the culture, how different the culture here was from my country.

Kevin: What would you say are the main differences between the culture where you live and the culture of where you came from?

Daisy: Well, the culture here, it's a bit more...in terms of money, yes, I was earning more here than I was in my country because my country is known to be poor and we don't have the same resources. 

Kevin: My first question for you today is, what do you remember from when you first moved to the area that you live in right now?

Daisy: Well, they used to be a big forest and now we see trees getting cut down because they're building new apartments. We have a new school that was built and things are like starting to grow, the population is raising so they're trying to get more apartments in.

Kevin: With all these new changes, is there anything that you miss? Like family, anyone close to you? 

Daisy: I miss my neighbors. 

Kevin: Which neighbor?

Daisy: I miss my neighbor Marty. 

Kevin: What happened to him? 

Daisy: He was a good man but sadly he had to pass away.

Kevin: How did you meet this Marty?

Daisy: Well, when we moved in, he was a friendly man. He knocked on my door and gave me a nice home welcoming gift and introducing himself to me. 

Kevin: What are some of the things that you most like about the area that you live in?

Daisy: I enjoy how the community is united. You can see that in the park, they have events, either it's playing a movie and we're all as a neighborhood coming together watching this movie. Or either when my kids are playing at the park, everybody is so friendly.

Kevin: Give some of the biggest changes that have happened when you moved here?

Daisy: Some of the biggest changes were that the metro was so close by that I didn't have no use for my car anymore. I could have just hopped in the metro and went to my job that was located in DC. Another big change was that I was finally able to meet my neighbors not like when I was living in an apartment. In our apartment everybody was so secluded, that I didn't even know what my neighbor's name was because we were...since we don't...we didn't have a yard or anything we didn't really communicate. We would just go straight into our apartment and here when you're...when I was outside gardening, some of my neighbors would come and compliment me about my flowers and we would spark up conversations. Which is something I really do enjoy moving into this house because I could relieve stress, I planted so many apple trees because it's my...it's like my property. 

I get to do what I want with it not like when I was living in an apartment that I didn't have a sense of ownership in there. In this house, I'm able to do that I'm able to grow and see my kids grow in such a great neighborhood and how they could just walk to school and everything is so conveniently placed where I want them to be and I'm grateful for that.

Kevin: ...the weather has changed in your area?

Daisy. Well, it has drastically changed because I remember one winter around, maybe the 2000s there was snow up to my thighs. It had been a blizzard that hit and nowadays you could see that sometimes it rarely snows or sometimes it snows like around February or later on in the year. Not as when it used to snow like in actual winter months like November, December. And it has really surprised me because ever since that year, I haven't seen another blizzard that had hit that hard.

Kevin: Besides the winter, what other seasons would you say have changed drastically or at all? 

Daisy: Well, we could also see the summers actually changing a little bit. Like in the beginning of some summer months we still see snow, like, recently it started snowing in March when it's supposed to be spring where you could see the temperature warming up.

Kevin: Well, those are all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time.
