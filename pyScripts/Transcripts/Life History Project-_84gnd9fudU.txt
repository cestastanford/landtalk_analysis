Interviewer: Okay. We discuss the house in the barn as being a place that you know well. How long have you lived here?

Interviewee: I lived here at least 45 years.

Interviewer: And what made you choose this place to live?

Interviewee: It was my husband's folks' place and the brother didn't want to live here no more, so we said we would move here. So that's how we ended up at the home place.

Interviewer: Okay. And there's a barn here also. What has it been used for?

Interviewee: Horses, storing hay, milking cows, and pigs.

Interviewer: Okay. How has it changed over the years, the house in the barn?

Interviewee: It hasn't changed much. We tend the barn. It had wood shingles. So we tend the barn and then we painted it a couple of years ago. And the house...we enclosed the porch and made a washroom on the porch. And then we kind of remodeled the inside. But as far as changing the house, it didn't change much.

Interviewer: Okay. And has your property overall changed a lot, like building-wise and stuff?

Interviewee: Yes. We took down a lot of old buildings that we had for hogs. We figured we didn't need it, so instead of paying tax on it, we doused the more torn down and then we built a new machine shed instead of all the little outbuildings, and put up a granary.

Interviewer: Okay. Let me think of something else. What about the animals? Did you have many different animals or just...because I know people today only specialize in one thing. Did you have multiples?

Interviewee: Yes. We had horses, we had cows but we didn't milk them, and we had sheep, and then we had some goats.

Interviewer: What about ducks and chickens? Did you have those, too?

Interviewee: We had some chickens, not very many, just butchering chickens. And then I always raised some ducks. And then we butchered those in the fall.

Interviewer: Okay. And what kind of crops did you guys raise on the farm?

Interviewee: We raised wheat, some milo, beans, corn, and alfalfa. And then also the NRD kind of took our ground away, about 40 acres of ground, and they made a NRD dam there. So that took all of our good land which was very level, and now it holds 20 acres of water. And that was made in about...

Interviewer: Is that south of the house?

Interviewee: Yeah, that big dam. And people went fishing there and grandkids. And we had sometimes get-together on Fourth of July.

Interviewer: Do they still raise the same crops today on your farm as well?

Interviewee: Yes. It was pasture and it went on to crops. And the dam is probably 40 years old.

Interviewer: Did you also have a garden?

Interviewee: Yes. I did have a garden and my mother-in-law had it by the house. And you know how the garden gets. It gets sweetie in the fall. Anyway, mine did. And so I don't like weeds by the house, even though I kept it clean. I put it behind the house, by the corral, and so that was much better that way.

Interviewer: What did you grow in the garden? And do you still grow the same stuff today or...

Interviewee: Pretty much except strawberries. I don't raise strawberries because you have to keep them really, really clean, and there's nothing that takes care of the weeds. And so I don't raise those but I raise cabbage and cucumbers.

Interviewer: Corn and beans or...

Interviewee: Corn, beans. So, can a lot of stuff, not as much as I used to. We used to can about 100 quarts of cucumbers and 100 quarts of beans. But my one grandson...he just loves corn. So I freeze that and he just eats it and eats it. You can't fill up on that corn on a cob.

Interviewer: How did you upkeep your farm, as in like pastures and the crops and stuff?

Interviewee: Well, we did a lot of like tree cutting, get rid of the old trees, cut evergreen trees, filling the ditches when it washes away, and made some terraces. So that keeps the water from running into the dam.

Interviewer: And that's pretty much what they still do today. Nothing's really changed there.

Interviewee: No, nothing's really changed.
