Interviewer: Okay. So, welcome to Land Talk. So, the first question I was gonna ask you is what has changed since you moved here? It's like, in general, what are things you can remember?

Interviewee: Okay. Well, we moved here in 1997. So it would have been 22 years ago. And when we first moved here, it seems like we had deeper snows. We had bluebirds, and we don't have bluebirds now. The flooding is more frequent and more severe. We do have a lot of creeks around here, and when we get a lot of rain, [inaudible 00:00:57] floods...I'd say three, maybe four times a winter, almost every February, at least. And when we first moved up here, maybe once a winter, something like that. So, wetter and not as deep a snows now. The land is...it seems less dark. The soil seems a little less dark. 

Interviewer: Just, like, in color?

Interviewee: Mm-hmm.

Interviewer: Is the texture of the soil any different, do you think?

Interviewee: It seems sandier, but I can't tell. Maybe it's just the way I'm looking at it. But it seems sandier. 

Interviewer: All right. So, with regards to, like, the woods, have they changed a lot since you moved? 

Interviewee: Yes. The types of trees that we have has definitely changed. We used to have a lot more, kind of, the older oaks. We used to have oaks, but we really don't have any of the old kind of acorns right now. And there are a few paw-paw trees here in the yard. I believe there used to be more. Even the [inaudible 00:02:39] are dying out. And [inaudible 00:02:43]. There used to be more owls [inaudible 00:02:51] when we first moved here. I think there are three left now. When we first moved up here, there were quite a few.

The trees [inaudible 00:03:03] are the type that have...they're thinner leaves. They're not nearly so straight and tall and...strong, I guess you'd say. It seems. And we definitely have more of that...what's that invasive species down by the creek? I thinks it's kudzu.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

Interviewee: I think we have a little kudzu, and it is not [inaudible 00:03:32] that I can remember. And there's a little bit more [inaudible 00:03:37].

Interviewer: All right. So, you were talking earlier about the weather, and you said you think it rains more. Or do you think it was just, like, you think the temperature has changed a lot, and that's affecting the rainfall, or what?

Interviewee: I do think it rains more. I think the biggest change, though, is that there's no place for the rain to go. So when it does rain very quickly, used to...we didn't have quite as many...I guess the creeks are not as big. [inaudible 00:04:17] smaller creeks, and so they tend to overflow more. And upstream, they don't have as many open areas and there are a lot more [inaudible 00:04:27] and impervious surfaces. And so when it does rain, it doesn't have time to just slowly soak in. It rains so hard, it just runs off. And it [inaudible 00:04:38] collect a lot more quickly [inaudible 00:04:41].

Interviewer: All right. So, you mentioned that we used to have bluebirds. That was, like, the wildlife, it's like the bluebirds and owls change.

Interviewee: Mm-hmm. The birds are definitely different. We used to see more turkeys, just right here down in the yard. There's still turkeys in the area over [inaudible 00:05:12], but not necessarily on this property. I don't know if they were here just because [inaudible 00:05:17]. But definitely [inaudible 00:05:23]. And...I don't know. Definitely the honeybees are much, much less than they were 20 years ago. And the dogwoods are also a little bit less than we had before, which I know is not wildlife, but...

Interviewer: [inaudible 00:05:48]

Interviewee: Yeah. [inaudible 00:05:51] think about the [inaudible 00:05:52]. We've had coyotes the whole time, so that's not really a change. We had more raccoons before. We don't see so many raccoons now. Opossums were always around. I guess besides that, that's pretty much, I would say...I really can say for sure. 

Interviewer: Okay. So, like, outdoors, do you have stuff that you liked to do when you first moved here that you, like, can't do anymore?

Interviewee: Yeah. There were quite a few grape vines, and those big grape vines that kinda hang the trees. And, so, those were great to, like, actually grab 'em and swing out from the side of the hill. We really don't have that many of those now, and the ones that we do have don't seem as sturdy. They seem brittle. So, I'd say that's one thing. And I know that the families that lived here before used to like to slide into the creek from the [inaudible 00:07:18] when it was [inaudible 00:07:20] mud, which we've never really seen that as an option. I'm not sure where [inaudible 00:07:28] that. We can still say that we can go out on the lake when it's frozen. So, we can still do that. I can't really think of anything that we can't do.

Interviewer: Do you think the lake gets frozen less often than it used to? Or is it about the same?

Interviewee: That's a good question. I can't really tell for sure, so maybe about the same. I'm not sure I know. 

Interviewer: All right. Do you have new things that you like to do outside that you couldn't do before?

Interviewee: I like to just go sit outside, but that's not a new thing. I'd say no, I can't really think of anything new.

Interviewer: All right. You mentioned more erosion by, like, the creek. So, like, could you elaborate on what kind of erosion there is, then?

Interviewee: Sure. So, on the other side of the creek, adjacent to this property, there's a huge field with farm land. And [inaudible 00:08:50], they definitely try to...I guess we [inaudible 00:08:58] to do that, they have taken away some of the banks on the side of the creek, you know, which actually created more erosion, because they took away the roots and the grasses that were growing along the side of the bank. And when they did that, it actually created a potential for more erosion, because floodwater had started taking the bank away. 

Interviewer: All right. Is there any new changes to the lake that you've noticed? [inaudible 00:09:29], like, wildlife or, like, water levels?

Interviewee: Mm-hmm. Just this year, we really noticed a big change. This time, when it flooded, the water actually did not recede at first very quickly at all. [inaudible 00:09:46] the overflow, which is very unusual. In the past, whenever it would flood, it would get to the overflow level but then it would go right back down. So, this year, it's just stayed high. So that's definitely a change. And what is the other part of that question?

Interviewer: Like, with the wildlife, is anything different?

Interviewee: Oh. So, this time every year [inaudible 00:10:14] to the lake, and one pair of geese usually lays in a nest. This year, we had maybe six other pairs of geese that try [inaudible 00:10:25] one nest. So, more geese are vying for the same area. And the fish in the lake are definitely different. We used to have more bluegill. What's the...

Interviewer: Catfish?

Interviewee: Catfish. And now, it's almost all catfish. And I do think that we have a snapping turtle in the lake. When we first came, I don't think there was a snapping turtle. So, those are a few changes. There's still a lot of tadpoles. [inaudible 00:11:10].

Interviewer: All right. [inaudible 00:11:14]. I think that's pretty much it for the interview. And, yeah, thank you for you time.

Interviewee: You're welcome. Thank...
