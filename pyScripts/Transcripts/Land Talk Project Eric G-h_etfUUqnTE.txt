Interviewer: All right. So, where are you from?

Interviewee: San Francisco. 

Interviewer: All right. And which district?

Interviewee: Currently living in the Excelsior District. 

Interviewer: Okay. Did you grow up around the Excelsior?

Interviewee: I did. I did, until I was about 18 years old. But then, I came back when I was about 35.

Interviewer: Okay. So, about how long have you lived in the Excelsior in total?

Interviewee: I would say, god, was that 30 years, 35 years?

Interviewer: All right.

Interviewee: Somewhere in that range.

Interviewer: Okay. And how was the neighborhood back when you were growing up? How do you remember it?

Interviewee: You know, it was very friendly. It was very safe. Mostly Latino back then. You know, my parents didn't speak a lot of English. They had a lot of friends in the neighborhood. You know, it was a very friendly neighborhood. Everybody knew each other. Other neighbors had very close relationships. It was just a great place to grow up.

Interviewer: All right. And how would you say it's, like, different now?

Interviewee: You know, the big difference is a lot of the people that had homes when I was growing up, as soon as, you know, as they get older and they pass away, their kids inherit the homes, the values, the home values, they skyrocket. So, you know, or if the kids inherit the homes, they sell them, split the money up among those kids, and then they move. So, it's just kind of a revolving door. There's a lot of mobility in the neighborhood. Whereas, you know, back when I was growing up, I had the same neighbors for years, you know, 15, 20 years. But nowadays, it seems like we're having new people move in, you know, every few years or so. People buy a home, they live in it for a couple of years. Once the value appreciates, they sell it, take their earnings, take their gains, and move outside of the neighborhood. So, it doesn't have the same cozy, I guess, friendly feel that it used to. Not to say it's a bad neighborhood, still very nice people, safe neighborhood, but you just don't get to build those relationships that we used to have.

Interviewer: And I guess, what do you think the main cause of that is?

Interviewee: Well, it's just the prices of the homes. First of all, before, you had a lot more kids in the neighborhood because, you know, when I was growing up, you'd go down the street and you'd get a football game or a basketball game. There was just always kids in the neighborhood. You don't see that nowadays. Nowadays, you [inaudible 00:02:36] San Francisco, you have to have two working people, sometimes a lot of people, buy homes together because that's the only way they can afford it. So, a lot of those families with children are moving to the suburbs, because it's just more affordable. You get bigger homes for your money. So, I think that's the biggest change. You know, gentrification, obviously, plays a role in it, but I think it's just to do with, you know, it has a lot to do with the value of the homes and what the homes cost nowadays. A lot of families are precluded from buying homes in San Francisco now. 

Interviewer: Yeah. And so, you think it's like an overall San Francisco thing and not just Excelsior District specific?

Interviewee: I think it's overall. It's like, I think the Excelsior's one of the last neighborhoods in the field. I think we have seen this a lot in the entire city, it's just starting to hit... You know, the Excelsior's on the outer edge of San Francisco. It's on the southern part close to Daly City. So, it's finally making its way to the Excelsior, to Hunter's Point, to Bernal's Heights. These traditionally, you know, Latino, African-American neighborhoods are now starting to see a lot of this, whereas maybe 10, 15 years ago, that wasn't the case. So, we're starting to see a lot more of that now.

Interviewer: Would you have the neighborhood be sort of the same, like, similar to how it was when you were growing up or now?

Interviewee: Well, to be honest with you, I miss the old neighborhood. And again, I don't wanna say it's not friendly anymore. I don't wanna say, you know…but I miss knowing a lot of people. Now, I have people who live two houses up that I don't even know who they are. I don't even know their names. You know, we see each other, we wave, but we don't have conversations, we don't know....which is fine. So, it's good and bad. I miss that side of it. But definitely, you know, we have benefited from the increase in the property values of these homes, where my children will be able to benefit greatly from this home. My grandchildren also will benefit from this. So, again, it's a double-edged sword. It's bad in the sense of, you know, you lose the family feel, the friendly confines, the friendly touch per se. But, I mean, what these homes are worth now, honestly, it's kind of ridiculous, especially for what we paid for it. I mean, the value of the home had gone up five, six, seven times, you know? Where else are you going to be able to get this type of return on your investment? So, in that regards, it's very good. So, I guess I have ambivalent feelings, but, you know, overall, it is what it is. We've adjusted. I get it, it's good and bad. Does the good outweigh the bad? Does the bad outweigh the good? I don't know. So, it's actually comforting to know what this property is worth now compared to what it was worth when we bought it. 

Interviewer: Yeah. And do you think the social change, I guess, like, you're talking about how the neighborhood is like a little less friendly and a little bit less sense of community, do you think that's because of, like, the changing presence of the city or do you think that's just like a change in generations, where like before, people kinda had to go out and talk to each other to have interactions, but now you could sit at home and, like, sit on your phone and interact with people?

Interviewee: I think it's a combination. I think it's the fact that, you know, whereas before, people wanna live here, you know, the home values weren't increasing at the pace they are now. So, people would buy the homes, they would stay, and they would live in it, you know? A lot of our neighbors now, you know, like our neighbors to the left, she was there, she's been in that house 50-plus years, all right? As soon as she passes away, her children, who will inherit the house, they're gonna sell it and buy something somewhere else. You can buy a home outright by selling a house in San Francisco. You can probably buy multiple homes. I think a lot of it has to do with the mobility nowadays, you know? People aren't looking to… You know, especially in San Francisco where, you know, the whole Silicon Valley effect, right, where it's people are coming in buying homes. In a year, the homes appreciate, they take their winnings, and they move on to bigger homes to so-called better neighborhoods. I think it's the upward mobility of this generation, which the previous generation, my parents' generation, you know, my generation, I'm not looking at doing that. I'm looking at the stability, providing for my kids. You know, a lot of these people nowadays, you know, they're late 20s, early 30s, no children. So, they're just looking to continue to move up the corporate ladder, move up the ranks financially and socially, and the only way to do so is by continuing to a buy bigger, bigger home. I think that has a lot to do with it. 

Interviewer: Okay. So, we're doing pretty good on time now. So, do you have anything, also, any final comments, anything else you notice changing about the city of the neighborhood specifically?

Interviewee: No, that's it. I mean, you know, the demographics have obviously changed. [inaudible 00:07:33] it's more of a Latino-based community. Now, it's much more diverse. You see a lot more Caucasians, you see a lot more Asian people than when I was growing up. You know, just the whole city. It's actually now a reflection of true San Francisco. You have a lot of, you know, same gender couples. You have, you know, all... It's just a melting pot now, whereas before, it's predominantly Latino. So, yeah, that's a good thing, right? More diversity but, you know, you kinda lose the, you know, I don't wanna say the friendliness, because our neighbors now are very friendly people, some very nice people in there but, you know, we don't have the same type of relations, as my children will have the same type of relationships that I had growing up because there aren't a lot of children in the neighborhood anymore. It's mostly adults. 

Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. All right. Cool. Thanks, Dad. I appreciate this. Appreciate the help. 

Interviewee: All right. Thanks, buddy. 

Interviewer: All right. We're all good.
