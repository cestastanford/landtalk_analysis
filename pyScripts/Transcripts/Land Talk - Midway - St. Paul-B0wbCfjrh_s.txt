Interviewer: Hello. Thanks again for agreeing to talk with me. Can you give a little bit of an intro about yourself, like your name and your age and how long you've lived in Minnesota?

Interviewee: Okay. [inaudible 00:00:15], everybody calls me Chichi. I'm 41 years old. I've lived in Minnesota 41 years. Yeah.

Interviewer: Cool. So what are you going to be talking about today?

Interviewee: I will be talking about all the changes I have seen and experienced in the Midway area of St. Paul, which is only a few miles away from the actual St. Paul capital.

Interviewer: Okay, cool. Is it like a big town, small town?

Interviewee: It is I'd say like a, it's a small city. You know, it's not like a small town. It's definitely like a city, but it's a small city.

Interviewer: Okay, sounds good. So you used to live there when you were... were you born there?

Interviewee: I was born in Minneapolis. I don't know how familiar everyone is with the Minnesota, but it has twin cities, St. Paul and Minneapolis. They're right next to each other. So if you combine the two together, that makes her a rather larger city. But each city has its own personality. And I was born in Minneapolis. I lived there until I was about seven and then moved to St. Paul with my family and I grew up there.

Interviewer: Okay. So what kinds of things did you use to do in the Midway area?

Interviewee: Definitely, just, you know, going up there, there's a few things that I enjoy doing. We had actual train traffic went behind our house. So we would often, us kids, walk along the train and then go visit the gas station just to buy things. There's other kinds of local stores just up and down one of the major roads we call Snelling Avenue. There was like a Dairy Queen same road with the gas station on it. And then just not much farther from where I lived, but close to Snelling Avenue is an area that's called Midway. And Midway is, they call it Midway because it's right on the border of Minneapolis and St. Paul. And it has a lot of little shops and stores, restaurants, chain food stores and a few offices and office buildings, just kind of in that area. And then as you head towards Minneapolis, it becomes more, at the time when I was young, it was more office buildings.

Interviewer: Okay. So exactly, like can you talk a little bit about what kinds of stores they were?

Interviewee: Mm-hmm. A lot of them were like small chains stores. So the area that I, you know, spent the most time in was a strip mall and it had a grocery store, which was a Rainbow, and then Cub Foods, the Catina Cub Foods, down the line. And then it would have...

Interviewer: What are Rainbow and Cub Foods?

Interviewee: And then it would become like a Hollywood video. There was a Hollywood video. So multiple banks, Joann Fabrics, Scott's stuff like that, Payless, like lots of little shops. And then also there would be large office buildings that, you know, multiple people can rent out offices in. And then large chain restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, Perkins or Embers, which were like breakfast houses. Like, you know, you could go there to eat breakfast or hamburgers all day long. There was the kind of things that were there. Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. And what kinds of things are there now?

Interviewee: All right. So it's very different now. In that area where there was the called the strip mall area, they tore down a lot of those small, you know, chain stores and built up a huge soccer stadium. That's really kind of, I mean it's highly, I think people were gonna be excited to have the soccer stadium, but it's very awkward-looking in that location, at  least to me. And they had a light rail that goes up the major road we call University Avenue. It's called University Avenue because the University of Minnesota, is in Minneapolis at the very end of the University Avenue. So just if you were headed farther west you'd fine the University of Minnesota. So University Avenue comes up and through St. Paul and in the middle of that road now is a light rail. The light rail was good in that it brings a lot of people, you know, up and down University Avenue, who otherwise would have to take a bus or would have to drive. It is awkward because it cut into the middle of the road that was there and changed the entire aesthetic of the area.

Interviewer: I see. Can you talk a little bit more about how it changed the aesthetic? 

Interviewee: Well, the entire energy of the place has changed now. A lot more people or you see a lot more people walking and moving through the street on foot, whereas that wasn't the case before, most people drove or took the bus. It has arrowed the road, increased traffic. What else has it done? I think for the people who made it through the transition and for the light rail, because the light rail, the building of it kind of cut off the ability of a lot of those shops in that area to get business because there was no parking for awhile for some of them. A lot of them were worried just talking to some of the restaurant owners when I would visit them, were worried about that happening and it did. So I think it did cause some of the shops in the area to close down that couldn't make it through. It took quite a few years for them to finish building that light rail. But now that the light rail is there, those citizens that survived and the new businesses that have come in have that traffic coming through there of customers. So it is a lot more busy and a lot more populated I think than it used to be. And I think also that increase in traffic has decreased the safety of the area.

Interviewer: Oh. So would you say it's like not safe anymore?

Interviewee: Yeah, I would say that, you know, when I was younger it wasn't unusual to, you know, just be walking around there at night, you know, especially if you were passing through there on your way home from somewhere else via the bus especially, you know, as a teenager. But now, you know, with the increase in traffic, so many people going through there at all hours, it's not quite as much as safe. And it has started to get a reputation of being unsafe as well, which it didn't have when I was younger.

Interviewer: I see. That's very interesting. All right, well, thanks for chatting about Midway.

Interviewee: Yeah, no problem. It's still a great place to visit from time to time and it has really good restaurants. It's very diverse too, by the way, which is a change that has happened since growing up there. A lot Mong[SP] and Somalia and restaurants, which are all very... and Ethiopian restaurants too, which are really, really great places to go and eat. And, yeah. 

Interviewer: Oh, yeah. What kinds of things do you do there now?

Interviewee: Mostly restaurants. If I go in there as to, it's because I really want Mong food. I love Mong  food, which is a huge thing in... Here in Minnesota, we have a really large Mong population. Some Somalian food there too, but it's mostly Asian. Not only just restaurants, but grocery stores and being Nigerian American, we tend to shop at Asian grocery stores because they ship in a lot of African food. So that's what usually brings us to Midway most of the time.

Interviewer: Cool. Okay. Thanks. 

Interviewee: Yeah.
