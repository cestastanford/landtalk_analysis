Interviewer: Go.

Louisa: Hi, my name is Louisa Hayet, I have lived in Santa Barbara since 1988. Went there to go to UCSB and currently still live there. A lot of changes have happened in that town.

Interviewer: How did this place look before?

Louisa: When I first moved there?

Interviewer: Yes.

Louisa: Let's see, the 101 had a stop sign on it, or a stop light on it where you would actually stop. And we had the big historical fig tree right there, and anybody that was crossing from downtown Santa Barbara would have to wait for the train to go by too, so sometimes you were waiting for about seven minutes to get across the freeway with the light. Way less people. UCSB was not as big as a campus. Where there is a lot of housing where, playing fields where Iso-soccer used to be played. Campus looks completely different now. The UCSB downtown Santa Barbara and a lot of vacant businesses down there now. It's not how it used to be walking around with individually, privately, locally-owned businesses with different characters. Now it's corporate or it's an empty building because the rent is so high, it takes forever to get across town because of the traffic. Our two-lane, three-way, two-lane freeways are starting to go to three lanes, or in the midst of construction to get it that way, yes, it's changed a lot.

Interviewer: How has it changed?

Louisa: We have a totally redone airport. Instead of our tiny little Santa Barbara Airport, it's now a very fancy airport. Not as many flights come in and out though, which is interesting. Now it's a big new fancy airport with less flights. What else has changed around there? I kind of think I said it.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you used to do here?

Louisa: Used to do but I don't do anymore. I think I do a lot of things that I always have done. Except I pay attention to traffic a lot more. If I want to go south down to Carpenteria or something, definitely have to pay attention to when the traffic is super bad and definitely don't travel on the freeways on a Sunday or a Friday afternoon. You'll have to go into that now.

Interviewer: What are some of the things you do here now?

Louisa: Do here now. Stay out of the car more. That are different, I don't go downtown as much. Not many locals do go downtown. Downtown is filled with a lot of tourists now.
