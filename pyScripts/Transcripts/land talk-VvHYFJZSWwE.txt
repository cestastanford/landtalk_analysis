Interviewer: Yeah, I remember seeing photos of our neighborhood before you guys moved there and while they were building all the houses, or before. And it was just all woods, like that hill.

Man: Oh yeah.

Interviewer: Yeah, huh, okay. So what did you do then at that time when you were moving in if there wasn't really anything going on?

Man: Take care of you and Kavi. [SP]

Interviewer: Okay, fair enough. So were the woods pretty much immediately inaccessible as soon as you guys settled down, as soon as the houses were all built?

Man: Say it again.

Interviewer: So the wooded hill where our neighborhood now is, once you guys moved in was that pretty much inaccessible or did you still...

Man: They had roads already.

Interviewer: Okay, so you weren't really spending any time in those undeveloped areas?

Man: No, no. If I remember correctly what the developer was saying, they worked at it for about a year because the town, they had to deposit, I think, a million dollars with the town. And then the agreement was that they would make a sewer, they would do paved roads, etc., etc. And then put up all the utilities, the gas, the telephone, the power.

Interviewer: Right.

Man: And then once everything was done to the town of Greenburg's satisfaction they can get their money back.

Interviewer: Okay, cool.

Man: Mom and I never came here when this was all woods. It already had the roads.

Interviewer: So by the time you guys moved in were you just, what was the downtown area of White Plains like at that point? Is that where you spent your time?

Woman: No, because it wasn't that great. Until the Ritz Carlton was built up and that was in 2008, I'm looking at it now. 2008 was when the Ritz Carlton.

Man: Or City Center, was it City Center?

Interviewer: Mm-hm.

Man: Yeah...

Woman: City Center. Then there wasn't really much going on there. And the stores were run down and there were, like, dollar stores and just not really a good downtown.

Man: No.

Interviewer: Okay.

Man: Plus, like I said, we were taking care of the two of you.

Interviewer: Right, right.

Woman: 2008 when the city, White Plains, started to really get built up.

Interviewer: Right, okay.

Man: City Center.

Woman: Around the same time.

Interviewer: So when you weren't just at home taking care of me and Kavi in 1998 where'd you spend your time if it wasn't White Plains?

Woman: Hudson, Hudson Valley.

Interviewer: Okay, like where?

Man: Mr. Chan's Chinese food.

Interviewer: No, I remember going to lots of Hudson River Valley events when I was really little.

Woman: Yeah, we went up to Sunnyside and [inaudible 00:03:20].

Interviewer: Clubsberg Manor, Courtland.

Woman: Clubsberg Manor and...

Man: We went to [inaudible 00:03:26].

Woman: We went to Roosevelt State Park and, yeah some Hackley stuff, Skinting Academy. Remember those?

Interviewer: Yeah, okay.

Man: Bronx Zoo, we went a lot to Bronx Zoo.

Interviewer: Right, cool. So what do you think, I guess could you talk a little bit about how you guys are spending your time now in Westchester, in White Plains versus what you were doing in 1998 or even just the early 2000s as I was growing up?

Woman: Well now we could go to the city. There are lots of restaurants.

Interviewer: Or White Plains.

Woman: Yeah.

Interviewer: Or New York City, okay.

Man: No, White Plains [inaudible 00:04:21].

Interviewer: Right, right. Yeah, White Plains is pretty bustling now.

Man: Westchester Mall [inaudible 00:04:31] also, we never used to go Galleria.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Man: Right?

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: And Ridge Hill.

Man: Ridge Hill is also new but that's not White Plains anymore.

Interviewer: Right, so more like big shopping centers. Can you talk a little bit about the Westchester and what that's like because that's gone through some pretty major changes?

Man: Yeah, the Westchester Mall. So, it's a, what should I say, luxury mall or mall with luxury brands?

Interviewer: Yeah, I mean, well, because a lot of people who will be listening to this won't really know what Westchester is like.

Man: So the brands would be, they described it as Gap in the [inaudible 00:05:15].

Interviewer: Right.

Man: So [inaudible 00:05:20] was very surprised when he first came with us there, that it was carpeted.

Interviewer: Right.

Man: He said he's never seen a mall that was carpeted.

Interviewer: Right, yeah. It just keeps getting fancier.

Man: Right, but they took up all the carpet now.

Interviewer: Mm-hm.

Woman: And then shopping in Ridge Hill.

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: Right, and then going over to the Tarrytown, you know, by the river.

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: Because they built the Hudson Conservancy [inaudible 00:05:59] was building all the trails remember, by the river.

Man: The boardwalk.

Interviewer: Right. Okay, so there's still a good mix of, like, you can still go to parks and things like that in addition to spending time maybe downtown.

Man: Actually, they're developing parks, a lot of parks, is what my mom is saying.

Interviewer: Right.

Man: [inaudible 00:06:17] biggest indicator, we now have a Chipotle.

Interviewer: Okay.

Man: [inaudible 00:06:28]

Interviewer: Right, so do you think they're trying to still keep a pretty good balance of green spaces amid the city?

Man: Yeah, in fact, that was a lot of Tony's comments when he came here. He said he was very surprised about how much greenery there was.

Interviewer: Right.

Man: Because compared to Manila where it's all buildings and houses.

Interviewer: Right.

Man: Considering that it's still the suburbs of New York City that it was very, very green. And we feel that all the time during springtime, right?

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. And I guess with the river so close there's a lot of good opportunities to have scenic areas there.

Man: Yup.

Interviewer: Yeah, can you talk a little bit about, like, The Hudson River and how that's been changing or how that's been, like, a focal point of activity or not over time?

Woman: Right, remember there used to be a GE plant by where that park is now. And it was left, GE left it, they weren't operating anymore.

Man: No, GM.

Woman: GM.

Man: GM, General Motors.

Interviewer: Okay.

Man: There used to be a General Motors manufacturing plant in [inaudible 00:07:42].

Interviewer: Oh, gotcha.

Woman: And they closed it down, and so they converted that into a residential area.

Interviewer: Okay.

Woman: So they took Parkland, they took and converted the old GM plant into a kind of a luxury residential area. That was before they added the walkway.

Interviewer: Right, but they made the rest of it, like, a public park.

Woman: Yes.

Interviewer: Right. Cool, cool cool cool.

Woman: They're trying to connect different, so they're doing the same thing in Yonkers. They're doing this sort of thing where they can easily do it. And then they're gonna, the plan is to connect them all up.

Interviewer: Right, all right. So a lot of development but not necessarily overrunning the green spaces.

Woman: Yeah, I mean, here and there. I think our own subdivision was a major development because it cost their old woods. And then now we have houses here. And then close to the country club they turned it into another residential area. But nothing so massive.

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: Remember when I did the Google Earth to look over this whole area. There's still so much green space. Remember I showed you that picture.

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: With our area. And then further, I don't think there were really parks where the Ritz and City Center were built. They were old structures and low rise buildings.

Interviewer: Right.

Woman: That were replaced by high rise and commercial buildings.

Interviewer: Gotcha, okay. Well, thank you so much.
