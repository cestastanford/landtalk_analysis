Felicia: Hello, my name is Felicia Pfizer [SP]. I am interviewing my father, Daniel Pfizer. We'll be talking about our back yard and how it has changed over time. The first question that I'm asking you is what did our back yard look like when you was a child?

Daniel: Well, when I was a child, [inaudible 00:00:28] couple of trees. We had a sweet gum tree, an oak tree, and a blossom tree. Also we had a large swimming pool in the backyard, and pretty much that's about it. Everything else is about [inaudible 00:00:50].

Felicia: So, what happened to those trees?

Daniel: Well, they just died. Could have been from heat, could have been from...well, one was struck by lightning. One was...high winds blew it down, and the other one just kind of withered away.

Felicia: The next question that I would ask you is do you think that climate change is real?

Daniel: Yes I do. I think the products, the large corporations polluting the air, airplanes, all that's affecting the ozone layer, warming up the earth, melting glaciers, and also endangering animal life.

Felicia: So do you think it is affecting our backyard right now?

Daniel: As the backyard, I don't believe it's...maybe different types of plants are growing than from the past. But as far as the backyard, I don't think we've seen a major change. You see major changes through the air we breathe and, like I said, the polar ice melting, and heat in the other areas of the world, deforestation and things of that nature. But as far as the backyard, we don't see no immediate threats or anything like that.

Felicia: Do you think that it's affecting us? I know it's affecting us by diseases, but in other ways?

Daniel: Yeah, there are a lot more cases of asthma, like I said, breathing. I imagine also it's probably affecting the...I guess amphibious creatures, fish, because the waters are warming so we're kind of changing their environment, also. And, yeah, it's definitely having an affect on human life and animals.

Felicia: The third question is do you think that our earth will end because of climate change?

Daniel: I don't believe it's going to end because of climate change. Maybe other reasons but not climate change. I believe the earth will probably find a way to heal itself. For example, the magnetic points of the earth are constantly changing, which they can't figure out why, and that could be a way the earth is healing itself, by rotating on its axis possibly.

Felicia: What do you think we need to do to improve our environment?

Daniel: Continue with clean energy, windmills, electric cars, maybe electric planes to go a step further. Let's just...everything...let's go electric with everything.

Felicia: How has our backyard affected you while you was growing up?

Daniel: Well, you mean has it...

Felicia: I mean, like, the way how trees has fallen down, or grass has been growing and changing colors. Has it affected you in any type of way, or it's just natural?

Daniel: It's lots more work. I'd say it hasn't really changed in a way, just changed the scenery, a little corrosion here and there just like...like I said, Mother Nature has its ways and you just have to come to kind of work with it, so to say.

Felicia: Okay, I know that you have done, like, work in our front yard.

Daniel: Yes.

Felicia: You know, the concrete and all that stuff. So, has it, like...does it...in a way, does it harm...do you think that you're harming the environment by doing it, or...?

Daniel: As far as repairing concrete in the driveway and things like that, no, but what harms the environment is using herbicides, which to me it kills the...people use herbicides to just, to get rid of all the weeds, which contain flowers, wildflowers and things like that, to make just plain Bermuda grass or Kentucky grass or whatever. That also affects the environment because we have a decline of honeybees. And part of that could be because there are no wildflowers everywhere like there used to be. So that's a good...it could be a good way to bring back the bees, prevent all the herbicides.

Felicia: Well, thank you for your time.

Daniel: Oh, thank you.
