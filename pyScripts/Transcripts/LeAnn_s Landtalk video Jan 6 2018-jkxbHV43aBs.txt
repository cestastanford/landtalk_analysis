Interviewer: Please identify yourself and your location.

LeAnn: Ah, yes, my name is LeAnn Howard and I am showing a picture out the back window of our home. And, our home is located in a suburban area, fairly central, in Kansas City close to the state line between Kansas and Missouri. 

Interviewer: What drew you to this location?

LeAnn: We moved here over 30 years ago. It was after the birth of our second child. We needed a bit more space for our family. But, in addition, we were drawn to this gorgeous setting. Looking out, you can see walnut trees that have been here for many years and we sit in a forested area which is quite gorgeous. 

Interviewer: What is different about your setting today from when you first arrived?

LeAnn: Things have actually changed quite a bit and I have to talk broadly about it first, that weather patterns in our area have shifted. We're now getting stronger storms and those are been alternating with periods of some pretty severe drought. And during the storms, particularly over the past approximately 10 years, due to construction south of the city and more and more concrete, we sit above a creek and our creek is connected to other creeks out south, and the water flows along our creek and has flooded many homes. A number of homes in the area had to be torn down because of flooding problems.

Interviewer: What would you say has been the impact on wildlife since you arrived here?

LeAnn: There've been some pretty significant differences in the wildlife. When we first moved in here, it seemed like we were living closer to nature. There was a den of fox that lived just about a mile away and sometimes we could see them crossing snow in our back yard. There were deer around. We had more species of birds. I would see, occasionally, wood ducks sitting in the tree in our back yard. Warblers are now gone, don't see warblers at all anymore.

Interviewer: What have you done to modify your setting?

LeAnn: I've tried to do things to live with nature a little more effectively, so during periods of drought I've consulted with botanists who've come and looked at trees that I was afraid we might lose and got information about how to keep them alive during drought conditions. So far so good on that score. In addition, with a help of a neighbor and a good friend, we created a large berm at the top of our back yard and filled it with native plants and those native plants have helped to hold and solidify our back yard. So, we have less soil erosion and, in addition, we are drawing more invertebrates and some migrating butterflies because we have done this.

Interviewer: Thank you. Is there anything else you would like to add?

LeAnn: Ah, no.

Interviewer: Thank you, again.
