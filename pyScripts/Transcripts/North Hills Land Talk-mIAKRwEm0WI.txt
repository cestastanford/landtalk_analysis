Interviewer: I'm here with my mom, Alice Sein. And we're going to be talking about the Midtown Area of Raleigh, North Carolina. Mom, how long have you lived in Raleigh? 

Alice: I've lived here since 1992. 

Interviewer: Oh, wow. And when did you move to, like, the Midtown Area specifically or that neighborhood? 

Alice: Actually, I've always lived in the Midtown Area but we bought a home in '96, so we were more central. 

Interviewer: I know personally, growing up in Raleigh, and obviously, you know, you having lived there for a while now, the area has seen tremendous growth in the last 20 years. How did like North Hills Mall, for example, look when you first moved there? 

Alice: When we first moved here, North Hills Mall was a typical 1960s, '70s mall with basic needs stores there. And I wouldn't really describe it as a destination, I would describe it more as, you know, you went to get things you needed but it wasn't like a place to hang out. It was just sort of filled the void. And the whole area was sort of a no man's land, so to speak. 

Interviewer: Yeah, like our area of Raleigh at the time, like right around when I was born in '99, there was not a lot out there just north of the city, right? 

Alice: Correct. And I don't know if you'll look at any photos but in Raleigh, if you lived on one side of the beltline, it was kind of considered Old Raleigh [inaudible 00:01:29], but if you lived on the other side, it wasn't really desirable because there wasn't a lot there. And most people tend to migrate to the north part of the city where especially people relocating could buy bigger, newer homes with lots of land. A lot of building was heading that way because where we were was older, not a lot of things going on. Very much a no man's land. 

Interviewer: So you mean like north of where we live now, that's kind of where people were able to grow and develop? 

Alice: Yes. They probably headed about five miles outside of where we were. And people did not understand why we lived where we lived, which was kind of only about five miles from downtown but yet nothing really right here except older neighborhoods. But the population was growing older, there wasn't a lot of turnover, a lot of smaller, 1960s homes, and just not a lot of places to go to eat or walkability or anything like that that would probably look shiny and new to somebody relocating here. 

Interviewer: And it's like North Hills was really kind of the main area that people in that side of town could go to, but that's seen individually a lot of growth too, right? I was just looking at some pictures from like, you know, when it first became a good shopping mall and there was a ton of green space around North Hill specifically. Like a lot of trees. Most of those are gone now or it seems like we were really [crosstalk 00:03:02] down.

Alice: Yes. It was kind of controversial when they talked about shutting down the old mall and rebuilding it. And of course, like with any development, a lot of trees were cut down. There were a lot of issues between the neighbors and the city council and the developers with regards to creating buffers and making sure that neighborhoods still had their neighborhood appeal. But, of course, once they started construction and people realized that suddenly you weren't so desolate living here, you know, things were starting to turn, people bought into it a little bit better but we did lose a lot of green space and wildlife and traded it in for concrete. 

Interviewer: Yeah, and that's probably the biggest thing, looking at those older pictures where the JC Penney's is still there. Right? Yeah. But basically everything else has been...I mean, the size of the mall has what, like tripled, quadrupled just over the last 15 years?

Alice: Oh yeah, and it now encompasses all four corners of...that plot of land used to just be like kind of a tiny plot with a little parcel across the street. Now basically it's been transformed. I remember when you were little, it became its own destination. So all those people that talked about living, going North, they were always called North Raleigh. And for a while, people didn't know quite what to call us in the North Hills area because we weren't in the beltline but we weren't North Raleigh. 

And then once this development started to take shape and it kind of created this destination and a new name was born called Midtown. Kind of like, you know, and now it's a destination, a commercial destination and a residential destination. But it definitely has a price because there is not a lot of land available. And more recently, which you've seen, what little land was covered in trees is now being cut. 

Interviewer: Which is unfortunate from, like, certain people's perspectives, definitely.

Alice: Exactly.

Interviewer: Switching gears a little bit, back at the old mall like when you first moved to the area, what were some things you used to, like, go to the mall to do? 

Alice: We would go to the mall...if your office was located by the mall, you probably went to the mall to eat at the food court for lunch during your office day because it was quick and easy. There used to be back in the day a, like, gosh, I don't even know what you'd call it anymore. It's almost like a card store, like not like a Hallmark store now but where you'd go buy your newspapers, so if you want to read the newspaper and you didn't get it at your house, you could go into, it's like a new stand. You can go in there and buy any news you wanted, candy, snacks, almost like a pharmacy kind of thing. There were two department stores, you know, JC Penney's and a Dillard's. 

And I think there was a Gap, which was like the only thing...you know, it was very, very basic, very much not a destination. There were other malls in the city and this was the one that you went to if you needed to get in and out fast and it had what you needed. But it wasn't someplace you said, you know, "I need to go buy a dress for a wedding, let me go to North Hills."

Interviewer: I mean now there is a bridal store, right, on the...or there was at least?

Alice: There was. But now basically anything else you could want for or you see at any other major city is here. 

Interviewer: What specifically do you go to North Hills to do? 

Alice: Everything. We joked that well now it's such a desirable neighborhood that everybody who moved north thinks we're the smartest people in the world because we never joined the crowd and we stayed here. Because we can walk everywhere, I do my grocery shopping, I go to Target, I go to the Walgreen's, I work out up there.

Interviewer: Restaurants.

Alice: Yeah, go to dinner up there. I have family that comes to town and stays up there. We virtually do not have to leave this two-mile enclave if we don't want to. 

Interviewer: And my dad also works there, right?

Alice: Yeah, and you went to school there actually.

Interviewer: I went to school right there as well, middle school. That's definitely quite the transition that North Hills has seen. If you have anything else you want to add, for sure. 

Alice: I was just gonna say it's very typical, it's almost like living in a little city now because you can disappear, and once you get away from the, you know, commercial area and you do get into some pretty nice residential areas and the residents are pretty committed to kind of keeping that residential vibe. And even with the teardown housing that's going on, trying to maintain some of that wildlife and green space, not making it too cookie cutter to give it some old charm. 

Interviewer: Yeah, but definitely not as much as it used to be, but, yeah.

Alice: Definitely not.

Interviewer: All right, well thank you for talking with me about this.
