Loretta: I'm Loretta Willis. I live in Oakland, California.

Woman: How long? 

Loretta: Ask a [crosstalk 00:00:06].

Woman: What?

Loretta: I have lived in the Bay Area for 30 years, maybe 32.

Woman: Thirty-two years? Okay, and were you living in like... You moved at least once, right? You were in Berkeley originally?

Loretta: Yeah, I was in Berkeley for a while, San Francisco for a year, Marin for a couple of years, and then the last 20 some years has been Oakland.

Woman: Okay, so you've lived, like, in a good range of places then?

Loretta: Mm-hmm.

Woman: Do you feel like each of the locations you've lived in has...like the land has been very different in them? Or do you feel like there's been a general Bay areaness in all of them?

Loretta: The Bay area, in terms of... I don't know, the land seems kind of similar, but the weather is definitely microclimatey. So you're kind of in a different [inaudible 00:01:15] if you're in San Francisco versus Marin versus Oakland. And even Oakland and Berkeley are quite different just because of the weather patterns. 

Woman: Could you go into more detail about that, like what do you think is different about the weather patterns?

Loretta: Well, Berkeley is a little cooler and more foggy. And Oakland is a bit sunnier and dryer.

Woman: Makes sense. So since you've lived in Oakland the longest, we can focus on Oakland. Do you feel like you've seen the land change at all while you've been living here? And if so, in what ways?

Loretta: I guess it seems dryer in a way. We did go through that long drought period, so that would influence my feelings about it. But yeah, definitely, if you're talking about the land itself, that seems dryer.

Woman: Sorry, can you say it again? You kind of like froze up.

Loretta: Oh, if you're talking about the land itself, it seems dryer. 

Woman: Dryer in general?

Loretta: Yeah.

Woman: I mean, yeah, I definitely remember when I was little, it would flood occasionally. 

Loretta: Yeah. Well, definitely in Oakland itself, they've improved the drainage around the lake. And so, the flooding has really reduced from that. 

Woman: Yeah, that's true. I also feel like the lake has changed a lot too, like Lake Merritt.

Loretta: Oh yeah. That has improved considerably because they've improved the drainage and the estuary to the Bay, and so the wildlife there is better. And it smells a lot better. 

Woman: No more weird pink algae.

Loretta: No more algae

Woman: Have you actually, like, seen the wildlife in the lake change?

Loretta: Yeah, I think there's more fish in the lake. I think there are more different kinds of birds. I definitely think that the lake looks healthier. 

Woman: Yeah, that makes sense. Have you noticed anything change about the animals the live around here or I guess the people who protect the animals?

Loretta: So in terms of animals, you know, when I first was out here in Berkeley, I didn't notice a lot of wildlife, but it might've been in the more city setting. Since we've been in Oakland, I definitely noticed more wildlife, turkeys, occasional deer, less skunk. I remember there being more skunk around. There used to be a lot of raccoons, but that seems to have tapered off, but I think that's mostly because they can't get access to the cat food anymore. 

Woman: So that suggests our house [inaudible 00:04:21] specifically, basically?

Loretta: Yeah, I think that's pretty specific. I don't think that's in terms of the environment. Your dad would notice the birds more and changes in the birds.

Woman: That's true. I remember what Dad would complain about is the squirrels getting bigger because the cats keep... 

Loretta: Yes, I think the squirrels have gotten bigger. Lately, I've looked at the squirrels and I'm going, "Now there's like a Jurassic squirrel."

Woman: Do you think it's just because like the cats just eat the smaller squirrels? Or are the squirrels just getting fatter?

Loretta: I think the squirrels are, for whatever reason, are being better fed. They can get bigger. Maybe there are fewer cats around that can kill them. And then they can get bigger. Or maybe, they're responding to more cats and getting bigger [inaudible 00:05:13]. 

Woman: I don't know. It makes sense, but I have no idea. Have you noticed... I guess, I feel like Oakland, people-wise, has changed a lot. 

Loretta: Yeah, I think Oakland has definitely gotten lighter, more White people. And I think the socioeconomics has changed significantly. At least in our area, it's a lot younger people. And also, there's obviously a lot more money. But then, there are a lot more people on the street. So both things are happening...is that the people who are buying and renting have more money, and then that leads to a lot more street people, and people living in tents and people living on the street.

Woman: Yeah, that makes sense.

Loretta: So I think it also is denser than it used to be, in a way. 

Woman: I don't know if the changes have really translated to changing the look of Oakland at all yet. Do you think they have?

Loretta: You mean in terms of the housing and the architecture?

Woman: Yeah, the architecture and the buildings or... yeah, I guess the buildings or the land in general.

Loretta: I definitely see gentrification. I see the houses looking nicer and more fixed up, particularly, since we've been in our house for a long time. When we moved in it was a kind of scruffy area. And definitely, there's been a lot more renovations. Houses are definitely in better shape now. 

Woman: Yes. That's fair. All right, I think that's all the questions I need to ask you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

Loretta: You're...
