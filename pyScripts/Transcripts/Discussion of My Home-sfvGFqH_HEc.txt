How did this place look before? Well, there used to be a lot more snow. We did not have a pool in the backyard, it was completely flat. Lots of trees, deer, peacocks, and turkeys, and lots of birds. It's changed because we've taken down the trees, and we've actually put a pool in and a fire pit and a whole sitting area out there, but more importantly, we planted a flower bed. But we've always had hydrangeas. The biggest change, I think, is we used to have set seasons, and so it would snow, we'd get a lot of snow, and then come March, April it would start warming up and then everything would bloom in the summer, in the spring and the summer. 

Now it warms up so much earlier and so the trees think it is spring and then it goes back to normal. And so the birds are killed, and so my hydrangeas do not bloom as much anymore. As a matter of fact, last year I probably only had four hydrangea flowers, whereas before my entire backyard was filled with hydrangea plant. That's the biggest change, I think, is that it gets warmer sooner, but then you still have a cold spurt that kills a lot of the plants that you'd hope to see in the spring and the summer.

The things we do here now is that we have a pool, and then we have a fire pit and a sitting area, so we kinda extended our backyard entertainment area, which is fun, but again, you know, it's not as pretty as it used to be.
