Interviewer: Hi, Mr. Kluver, if you could just give a quick intro.

Charles: My name is Charles Kluver, I live in Omaha, Nebraska. I'm a retired attorney and I've time to spend at our place in Minnesota and thoroughly enjoy it. 

Interviewer: Great, so what's the name of the place that you'll be describing today? 

Charles: Well, it's a small lake in Minnesota in Cass County, Minnesota. The name of it is Ponto, P-O-N-T-O, and Ponto, the word is in Chippewa, means little jewel.

Interviewer: Okay, great. So I'll just be asking you about like any changes or like anything that you've seen or done. You mentioned earlier that you made some changes under the recommendation of an organization. What was that? 

Charles: We own a couple of cabins on Lake Shore and this group from Omaha in 1926, wanted the foremen outing club which was popular back that time and they found a bunch of acres on puddle and then additional, about 119 acres which they bought it. So there's 10 cabins and then a nonprofit corporation called the Omaha Lake Outing Club owns the 119 acres. Anyone who owns property in the Omaha beach as it's called has the right to use in a manner that is pleasing to the spirit of the usage of the land. And so we have been going there since 1968. 

Interviewer: Wow. 

Charles: We've had a chance to watch a lot of things change. The property that I'm talking about, the 119 acres, is timberland and at the butts are small pond type called, we've named that Ohamo, which is, of course, Omaha spelled backward. About 20 years ago, we had a sustainability review from the DNR Department of Natural Resources in Minnesota recommending how to take the proper care and husbandry of the land and that being a plan, 20-year plan, of which we followed, which included clearing two areas, two approximately 12-acre areas. 

One area was low... Anyway, we cleared the poplars with poplar trees, we cleared the trees on one. We did a clearcut, which meant we cut everything down and any timber that was there, we had Norway pines back then that were probably 80 feet tall. We sold those to the local lumbering company and then replanted the 12 acres, the 12 acres with Norway seedings, which were approximately three to four inches tall and those plantings now are probably 60 feet tall, thin, fairly thick and they're a not very thick population, but the trees themselves are not real thick, they are fighting to be up taller than the other tree to get the sun for growth. 

About the other 12 acres that we harvested, we didn't clearcut, we select cut, that's what it's called and that cut left a bunch of really tall Norway pine trees back at that time. And those trees having had a chance to watch those really suffered because the Norway pine are tall and their root system is not great. So they need the support of all the other trees, all their other brethren trees to withstand the winds. So those trees didn't fare very well. 

That was all under the direction of the DNR as then it was our choice to do either clear cut or select cut. Those trees now, the poplars in those trees are so thick you can hardly walk through them. Before you could walk through the poplars. They'd reached a maturity according to the DNR's sustainability study that they needed to either be harvested or they would start to just deteriorate and self rote on their own. So, the deer absolutely loved the new girls to try and walk through it is very, very difficult. 

The Norway Pines on the other 12 acres, now are branching and the undergrowth is going from heavy undergrowth now to just basically the droppings of the annual pine needles. So the usage, everyone has the opportunity to, of course, harvest firewood and hunting is done on a limited basis for deer, both archery and rifle. The pond or Hammal has no fish in it, we tried to put trout in and they didn't survive the winter. The raspberries are thick and everybody has their own secret raspberry patch, which they don't share. 

Interviewer: Perfect, so I guess just in more explicit terms, anything distinct about the way the place used to look compared to now? 

Charles: When we first started hiking in the backwoods and basically too on the woods at...but, the cabins...between the cabins and the road, we were pretty well covered on not having hangers, trees that are leaning, that have blown apart, or are blown next to another tree and the leaners were cut down for years from 1926 on. And it's just a part of the program to keep basically the ability to limit fire in the event there is a fire. If you get the trees down onto the ground and then they rot and they decay and there's less of a fire hazard. 

Back then we had a custodian that helped us do that and we have not had that for years, and that's a big change that I've noticed is that there are a lot of trees that are leaning that aren't down. And the forest is maturing, it's getting a little older. So we've had some terrible wind storms in the last five, six years that we hadn't had since '68 that we're aware. So things have changed. 

Interviewer: Okay, perfect. So what are some of the things that you used to do there? 

Charles: Well, the same thing we do now, basically, that's take good hike. We have developed what we call a biodegradable compost pile and this is where we take our pine needles, all of our composting materials, wood and we place that in a pit type area for it to decay. And we've changed the road, we had a road that would go down, we had a bulldozer come in and make a much more friendly road. And I ended up grading it and putting ryegrass down for a soil holder. They said ryegrass wouldn't work and I saw that it's growing greater. 

Interviewer: Awesome, so is there anything you do here now that you couldn't do before or anything you did before that you couldn't do now? You mentioned that you are hunting a lot now. Was that something you didn't do before? Is there anything else that changed in terms of what you did?

Charles: Hardly anybody hunted in the last...early on. It's just been as that generations change, the younger people that have grown up at Ponto now are opening their eyes saying, oh yeah, well, that's a beautiful place to go back and set up a tree stand for deer archery or whatever shooting. 

Interviewer: But besides that, everything was pretty much the same in what you did?

Charles: It's pretty much the same, yeah. 

Interviewer: Any other leisure activities that you do in Ponto?

Charles: Any other what? 

Interviewer: Leisure or maintenance activities that you do in Ponto? 

Charles: Well, every spring, whoever is going down the road, back to the biodegradable compost pile, it's their job to clear the down trees. So take your chainsaw and the way you go and clear the tree, clear it. But we just had a second sustainability book that had the people out from the DNR and wrote this book and they said we are doing exactly the best thing that could be done for that property. We're very, very good stewards. So we've got another 20-year plan. Basically, a little bit of that is maybe to thin the property, the trees, the poplars will thin themselves naturally, the Norway pine needs some help but that's interesting because there's differences of opinion, there isn't one solid agreement on how to do that.

So we're sort of waiting until maybe they decide that maybe this is better than that. 

Interviewer: That makes sense and just last question. When you say we, do you mean like the Omaha Outing Club or is this you and your own personal property or a mix of both?

Charles: Well, it's the Omaha Lake Outing Club, and there are 10 members, each member has one vote. And so we basically meet once a year and review, and then we have what we call Ponto Lake Homeowners Association, North Shore, Ponto Homeowners Association, which includes the 10 cabins and that's an informal association. And we have a caretaker who walks through and checks while we're absent after heavy snow during hunting time, heavy winds and keeps an eye on all of the cabins. 

Interviewer: Perfect, thanks so much. 

Charles: It's a wonderful spot and remember, Ponto means little jewel in Chippewa. 

Interviewer: Sounds great, thanks.
