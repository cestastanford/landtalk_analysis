Interviewer: Hello. We are here with Alexia Fernandez who has lived in New York for over 20 years. She is a regular at Central Park and lives very close to Central Park. She has been going to Central Park all her time that she's lived in New York, and today we're gonna ask her some questions about Central Park and how it's changed. So, Alexia, how did Central Park used to look like?

Alexia: Central Park, I lived in Central Park two blocks away. It's two blocks from my house and Central Park was only safe to go during the day. As soon as the sun go out, you know, when it start to get dark, it was very dangerous. I mean, there were a lot of people who were robbed and hurt. Now, you can go morning, afternoon, night. There's more light and it's safer.

Interviewer: Perfect. Have you seen a change in greenery in Central Park over the years and...?

Alexia: Yes. It used to be dirty and it used to be less trees. Therefore they're more careful. It's a little cleaner and I can see more trees around the paths, like, Central Park.

Interviewer: Where do you usually go in Central Park right now?

Alexia: I go to the reservoir. I go around the reservoir and it takes me 45 minutes in a slow walk. If I go faster, it would take me 25 minutes.

Interviewer: And what were some things that you used to do in Central Park 20 years ago and have those things changed?

Alexia: Yeah. I used to walk also and it used to be very dirty, and also not as green as before. Now, we feel there's more trees, more flowers, it's cleaner and especially safe.

Interviewer: And have you... You played tennis in Central Park. And have you seen a change in the way they keep the tennis courts over the past 20 years?

Alexia: Yes. I mean, I used to play tennis and the tennis court used to have holes. And it was really unsafe, you know, to play because they were not in good condition. Now, they are in an amazing condition and the lighting is amazing. And everything looks 100% better.

Interviewer: So over the years, have you changed your activities in Central Park because of the greenery, because of the maintenance and the way that they've preserved the park over the years? Have you gone...?

Alexia: Yeah, yeah. Over the years, it feels more relaxing to go because everything is in good condition. There's more trees, there's more flowers, they're keeping it in good shape. And we see more people taking care of the park than before. And now, they're putting names on trees in some of the path. And it's a good place also for the kids to go and to do sports, to do running, and also to learn about the vegetation.

Interviewer: When you first went to Central Park 20 years ago, did you see a bunch of workers there maintaining the park or was it barren?

Alexia: No. It was not too many. Now, there's a lot of volunteers that go through the day. You could see in the morning, in the afternoon, and you can ask them questions. You can learn about all the species that they have. The other day I was asking the name of a particular tree and they're very knowledgeable. You know, now, the people are...they know what they're doing and they're respecting the vegetation. They're doing it with love.

Interviewer: Do you have any friends that are involved in the park, and that are involved in donating to preserve the park?

Alexia: In the conservancy, yes. There's a foundation here that it's the Central Park Conservancy and I have a very good friend, and I donate. And I used to be in the board.

Interviewer: I see. And what does the Central Park Conservancy do and what's their mission? And was there a conservatory before when you first went?

Alexia: in good shape for our children, and the olds, and everyone. And to maintain the vegetation in good shape to make it clean, so everybody can enjoy it.

Interviewer: Do you know of any new plans in the park that they are trying to do?

Alexia: Well, they maintain for any season, you know. Usually, in the spring, they have particular trees that you can see different flowers. In the winter, they try to clean everything up for the next season. So it is beautiful. You can find different species and everything is clean. And it's really a beautiful place, you know, to be around.

Interviewer: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for spending time and talking about Central Park for everyone to learn, and the changes over time. Thank you.

Alexia: Thank you so much.
