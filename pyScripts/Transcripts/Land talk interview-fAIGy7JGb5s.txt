Interviewer: Hello Ms. Adkisson [SP], my name is Inference [SP] Johnson and I will be interviewing about the land talk. It is a program conceived by Stanford University that collects and presents conversations with observers about changes in outdoors over time. The first question I would like to know is, what do you remember from when you first moved here?

Interviewee: I remember that I automatically got sinuses when I first moved here. I never had problems with allergies or sinuses in North Carolina, which is where I mostly grew up, and I didn't know if it was because of the moisture or if a lot of development here in DC and Maryland are on swamps, so I didn't know if that was a change, because the humidity is quite the same as it is in North Carolina.

Interviewer: Okay, great. What is your favorite part about living here?

Interviewee: That I can make a living in a performing art in arts education area, as opposed to certain parts of the United States where that's a little bit more challenging to do as a independent artist and educator.

Interviewer: Okay. So what kind of hobbies have you picked up here?

Interviewee: What kind of what?

Interviewer: Hobbies?

Interviewee: I don't really have hobbies because I work all the time, so I don't have any hobbies.

Interviewer: I see. Is there any particular animal that you have seen here?

Interviewee: Black squirrels, which I've never seen in my entire life other than here, in this area.

Interviewer: Okay. What kind of trees or plants are like here that is like significant, or something that you haven't seen in other states?

Interviewee: I haven't cherry blossom that grows outside my house every year and it blooms for a very short period of time, and I enjoy it. But that's pretty much it. There's moss that grows in the backyard, which is weird, but then I realized that Mount Rainier was built on a swamp, so it makes sense.

Interviewer: Right. Has there been any big storms in the last 20 years?

Interviewee: Yeah. In 2009, there was an enormous snowstorm here. And I remember my first year of grad school. There was a really bad ice storm that kind of like took DC out for about three months as far as like, electricity problems, and it just constantly being cold and like regeneration of snow and ice. But I do remember in 2009, there was a snowstorm that was like 15 feet of snow and it was like a blizzard and it was like the first time it happened in years.

Interviewer: Right. Name something that you like and dislike about this area.

Interviewee: As far as geographic, or like nature, or like just in general?

Interviewer: In general.

Interviewee: The cost of living is really expensive here because it's based on people that get income supplement, which isn't the general population, that's the population that comes in every four years. So, if you are a person that's not a part of political backgrounders or government, it's incredibly hard to live here on anything less than $60,000 a year. And that's individual. So, I'm always baffled by people that are living here that are not making at least $50,000 a year. But then I realized that everybody here also works two or three jobs because it's impossible to live here and actually live as opposed to like live, pay your bills and do nothing else.

And I think that's a silly way of creating a economic system where it's based on these entirely like ridiculous salaries, but those people with those salaries are getting housing supplements so they're not paying what I'm paying, even though my cost of living is based on theirs. And I just think it's completely unfair and it keeps certain parts of DC poor and then those parts, because they're poor and they're underdeveloped, or they're not taken care of, then getting gentrified, which then jacks up the rates of people who have been in these communities, who built these communities forever, and it pushes them out. So, I think there's a backwards way of the way this particular town has been created economically that needs to seriously be looked at, and there needs to be more programs and more supplemental housing, and more supplemental income for people that are not a part of the government system.

Interviewer: Right. So, is there anything that you would like to say about this town that you think that it should improve on, or do you think everything is pretty good so far?

Interviewee: I mean, gentrification is a huge problem. It's a huge problem all over the United States, so it's kind of unfair to say that it's a problem specifically for DC. However, living in multiple areas of DC or the DMV, like having lived in Arlington, Rockville, Mount Rainier, and in DC, I've seen neighborhoods that were really culturally diverse and inclusive move to something that is not culturally diverse and inclusive, even though the people that are moving into those areas would say they are. If you're not doing anything to continue that inclusion in that diverse neighborhood, then you're a part of the problem.

And the ownership and the entitlement that is moving in without any kind of sensitivity to the people that built that community is a ginormous problem. So, I think we need to... There's nothing wrong with wanting to revitalize a neighborhood, but when you're just simply moving people out of that neighborhood or making rent and mortgages so expensive that there's no way they can stay in those neighborhoods, then you're not really revitalizing the neighborhood. You're just kind of moving a population of people out and moving a new population of people in, that have no sensitivity to the culture of the neighborhood.

So, I think that's a giant problem. And I think we need to figure out ways of more housing supplements and more housing programs, so that people that are working and making a living and trying hard to be a part of society and paying their taxes, and are working in the community volunteering, can stay in these communities so that they can be a part of the revitalization as opposed to being gentrified, which is just being moved out.

Interviewer: So, in closing, where are you currently resigned at?

Interviewee: I live in Mount Rainier, Maryland, and yeah, my neighborhood is part of that gentrification problem. But I will say that the people that have moved into my neighborhood recently have been very involved with the community, and I don't see the blatant disrespect that I'm seeing in other communities. So, I'm very happy about that. I still feel like I've lived in one of the most culturally diverse and inclusive neighborhoods in Maryland and in the DC area. So, yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you, Ms. Adkisson.
