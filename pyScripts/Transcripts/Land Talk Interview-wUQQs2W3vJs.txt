Interviewer: I'm here with [inaudible 00:00:01] and I'll be interviewing her about the land in the area where she's been living for the last 44 years. So I understand that you've been living here in Maryland for the past 44 years. What do you remember from when you first moved here? 

Interviewee: I moved here first when [inaudible 00:00:24] was super hot. And first day we had to buy some air conditioners. First day. And so coming from Japan to here was totally different temperature. June was super hot here in Baltimore. I'm a little bit near the [inaudible 00:00:45] and the weather was totally different from Japan to here. 

Interviewer: It's a lot cooler in Japan?

Interviewee: Yes. Not a lot cooler, but this place was a lot hotter. 

Interviewer: So it's more humid. 

Interviewee: More humid. 

Interviewer: Okay. All right. What's your favorite part about living here? 

Interviewee: I think I like the people. 

Interviewer: The people? 

Interviewee: Yeah, I definitely can say I like the people here. They're, like, more my type of people. 

Interviewer: So what do you think is the big difference between the people where you lived in Japan versus here? 

Interviewee: Okay. I think actually American people is more straightforward and so something is coming up, for example, they will tell you exactly how they feel but in Japanese they are not. 

Interviewer: They're not. 

Interviewee: So very hard to read where they're coming from, and I am not like that so I was a hard time, you know, read the people in Japanese. I still have a hard time doing that, so therefore I only associate with people in my family and a few of my friends, and I do not associate with anybody else. 

Interviewer: Okay, so...

Interviewee: But here I got a lot more different type of people. 

Interviewer: Yeah, so it's a lot more conservative over there, per se. 

Interviewee: Mmm...

Interviewer: Like in the attitudes of people. 

Interviewee: Right, the attitudes it's not true, they're not liar. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: They don't want to tell you, you know, really how they feel. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: So hiding their feelings, maybe. 

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: And I don't like that. 

Interviewer: So what kind of hobbies have you picked up here that are different?

Interviewee: Not really pick up anything, but I always interested in...so here, if you look for the classes and, for example, not credit, like a college, I still can go through, like, three weeks course, like, two times a week or maybe six times, seven times, eight times on a weekend to learn something you really want to do for without credit. It's not that so expensive. So I took lots of art class here for me to better jeweler, I guess. So I like that. 

Interviewer: Okay. So would you say that there are, I guess, more opportunities here to, like, visit...

Interviewee: For me, yes. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: We don't have to go to Tokyo or somewhere, you know, really big...I come from a big city too, but I can see here because it's more colleges, I guess, and so more classes offering here than where I'm from. 

Interviewer: Okay, so, like, there's more convenient areas nearby. 

Interviewee: Convenient areas and different subject that you can teach with the credit. 

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: So I like that. 

Interviewer: All right. How has, like, the weather or rainfall changed throughout the years? 

Interviewee: I think that it's not only here, in Japan as well, but definitely temperature is warmer. 

Interviewer: Warmer.

Interviewee: Yes. I definitely think so. And then wintertime, I think we have less snow lately than first I came in 1975.

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: A lot of less snow. 

Interviewer: Yeah. So you've seen, like, it's gotten warmer as the years have progressed. 

Interviewee: Right, right, right. Temperature-wise I think so. 

Interviewer: Okay. Have there been any big storms in the last 20 years? 

Interviewee: Well I know that big storms was...just recently have super big rainfall. Some street was totally blocked, so I have to go really around to get home and so lots of [inaudible 00:04:38] in the city, I guess. So car cannot go through it, but this is only first time I ever faced maybe two years ago, and really big rain storm. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: So that's only I know. 

Interviewer: Okay. What do you miss most about living here 20 years ago? So have you seen anything that, in the pasts 20 years, that maybe in the beginning that you might have done that you don't do now? 

Interviewee: Well after my...I have three children, and my youngest one is third grade, and I went to school, college, to become a teacher. So I pick up a lot in different people, and more eye opener for me than 20 years ago. And after I become a teacher and lots of different type of people I met. So not really missing, but I gained, I think. 

Interviewer: You gained? 

Interviewee: I gained. 

Interviewer: Okay. What do you like most about living here now? 

Interviewee: Like I said, I like the people here. 

Interviewer: The people here? 

Interviewee: Yeah. I like people here, I like the opportunity here. I feel comfortable here. 

Interviewer: You feel comfortable here. 

Interviewee: Yes. And yet I'm going home, last 20...like I said, last 44 years, or maybe 40 times I went home, 40 times out of 44 years. So it's not like I didn't go back. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: But, you know, so I can always see my friends and my folks in Japan because I'm visiting a lot. 

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: So it's not really missing anything, I just, you know, because they're home [inaudible 00:06:27] in Japan, so I just go home to just do that because [inaudible 00:06:31] coming back here. 

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: I know I can't live there. 

Interviewer: Yeah, you've grown for the US to be your home. 

Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

Interviewer: Okay. So thank you very much for allowing me to interview you. You did a great job. 

Interviewee: Oh, thank you very much.
