Trace: So, I am Trace Pitman [SP], speaking with my grandmother, Taylor Anderson [SP], who has lived in Tucson for over 20 years. And so we are just gonna go through some questions.

Taylor: Perfect.

Trace: So, the name of the location, is it Tucson or any more specific place in Tucson?

Taylor: Tucson is probably 500,000 people, so it's not that big. It's just in the...I've lived in the central area of Tucson.

Trace: Central area of Tucson. Okay. And it says to figure out the latitude and longitude, but I'm guessing you don't know that off the top of your head?

Taylor: I don't. I lived near River Road and Campbell Avenue.

Trace: All right. So, I shall figure out the coordinates later.

Taylor: You can, because it's two big streets, River Road, Campbell.

Trace: Okay. So, basically the idea of this is to figure out how Tucson has changed over the 20-year period since you lived there. So, the first question, when you first moved to Tucson over 20 years ago, how did it look?

Taylor: Well, Trace, you think you should say over 40 years ago?

Trace: When you moved to Tucson? Sure. So, 40 years ago.

Taylor: Yeah. I moved to Tucson in 1952. So I saw huge changes.

Trace: So how did it look before?

Taylor: Well, of course, it was much smaller, much, much smaller. And I can remember going downtown, there were no malls when I moved there, just the downtown area. And I can remember being downtown and seeing Navajo, who reservation was a long way, way north of Tucson in the northern part of Arizona, and seeing them inside one of the department stores, and they had... This is something that I will always remember. And they had on what...their native dress. And I thought, "Gosh, this is amazing."

Trace: What department store was it?

Taylor: It was Levy's.

Trace: What is Levy's. What were they shopping for?

Taylor: It was a department store. It was the men's department, I don't know why. Maybe they had something they had to go to or something, I don't know.

Trace: Okay. So, there were no malls and it was a lot smaller, and then what else about Tucson early on that's maybe different from how it is now?

Taylor: Well, I can remember when I first moved there in 1952-1953, you could go into what is now...there's a place where the Cleveland Indians used to play baseball and, you know, was called...it was Hi Corbett Field. And I'll tell you how that has changed so much. In those days the Cleveland Indians came there in the winter for spring training. So, people in Tucson would...you know, many people would go to the games.

Now, today, all the professional baseball leagues in the western parts of the United States, most of them go to Phoenix. So, Phoenix is a huge, huge baseball area and all...they have many, many teams there for spring training. So, the University of Arizona about three years ago purchased Hi Corbett Field and refurbished it, and that's where the University of Arizona now plays baseball whereas they used to play on campus.

Trace: Oh, so they got a big upgrade?

Taylor: Well, it was...they kept the charm, you know, of an old baseball field, and it's just college baseball, so none of the college baseball facilities are that huge. But when I was a little girl, now Broadway, right, today, is like...is a six, at least a six-lane street going from west to east and east to west. And it divides North Tucson, the northern part of Tucson from the southern part of Tucson. And I can remember going...there was an old hotel close to Hi Corbett Field, and I can remember riding horses from that stable at the hotel across Broadway to Hi Corbett Field.

Trace: Cool.

Taylor: I know, that was cool.

Trace: So, this is earth systems class. So, what about the environment when you first moved to Tucson?

Taylor: Well, you'll be happy to hear this. When I first moved to Tucson, we used to have terrible dust storms. And I don't...I really...I don't know if it was construction, I don't know if it was maybe new construction, because I don't remember. Tucson has never been like a money city, you know? So, we didn't have all the people flocking and building houses and all that. But we had huge, huge dust storms, and I remember as time went on and people planted grass and trees, and streets were paved, and that could have been it, that the streets...that were a lot more streets that weren't paved. So, that could have been, you know, what caused all the dust.

But it was really...You know, it was really problematic and you could go to your windowsill and put your hands across it and come up with, you know, red dust.

Trace: How long did that last?

Taylor: But that changed, that changed over the years. And it probably changed as people built houses and landscaped. When was that?

Trace: How long did it last? Just years or just a few months?

Taylor: No, I'd say like for three years, and now when you...Still when I...last year when I drove up I-10, which is the main freeway between Tucson and Phoenix. And Phoenix has horrible dust storms. Now they call them haboobs, where the day becomes night. And it could be because west of Phoenix there is a lot of construction, that they have these haboobs. And last summer when we were driving up, and even the summer before, that we...My friend and I thought they were dust storms. And they were bad dust storms, you know, where it hits your car and you can just hear it.

Trace: Oh, that's crazy. What about, like, the temperature when you first moved to Tucson?

Taylor: Well, Tucson, because Tucson is a lot like Denver. It's a desert, even though Denver...we don't realize it, but it's very...It's a desert climate, and there's very little irrigation. We have very little irrigation in Tucson. So this is interesting. The daytime temperature in Tucson even then when I first moved, and over the years, there's a 30-degree difference between day and night, just as there is in Denver, because it's so dry, when the sun goes down, it cools off.

Now, Phoenix has irrigation, and much more irrigation, and they have the Salt River. And they, when the sun goes down in Phoenix in the summer, it does not get cool like it does in Denver. So is that something that you could...

Trace: That's very interesting. So, at first there was a large temperature difference between day and night. Is that no longer the case?

Taylor: No, it still is. It's not quite as pronounced, but it still is. You know, you go in the day and it's nice and warm, and when the sun goes down, like even in April and May, it gets cool.

Trace: So, what were the average daily highs in the summer in Tucson in the '50s?

Taylor: Oh gosh. I would say probably in the 90s. The average was probably, you know, 90 to 94. And we did have, and I don't know...I don't think they have them and...Well, when I moved after 40-some years, some summers we didn't have them and we would be so...the people who lived in Tucson were so sad. But when I first moved there, and for years, we had...we called it the monsoon season. And in August you would have big, huge gully washers and it was so nice because it cooled the temperature down.

Trace: So, what about the winter? What were the temperatures like during the winter in the '50s?

Taylor: Occasionally we had snow, and it was...You know, you can't say that it was warm. My relatives would come out from Minnesota and I know several times coming through on the way to Tucson that you go through where Geronimo's stronghold was by...I think it's by Willcox and it's...I don't know if it's at Chiricahua Mountain, I don't...I can't remember. But when you went through there and you were at a higher elevation, you got snow. And I really could bet that doesn't happen now.

Trace: So, we talked about the temperature, precipitation, we talked about the monsoons and the snow.

Taylor: Yes, we did have monsoons. Occasionally snow.

Trace: And occasionally snow. What about like trees or foliage for instance? What was that like in the '50s?

Taylor: Tucson didn't have that many trees.

Trace: Did not have many trees?

Taylor: Yeah. And a lot of people...Like my parents were from Minnesota, so they planted palo verde trees which were indigenous to that area. So, they didn't have the big trees and they took so much water. And I did notice the last time I was in Tucson, last year, because water is now getting more and more expensive, more and more people do not have grass and it's still...it isn't like Phoenix. Because Phoenix gets the salt water from the Salt River and that...But that is also bad because then it has humidity and it keeps in the heat.

Trace: So, maybe now let's talk about Tucson today in light of temperature, precipitation, and trees.

Taylor: And do you wanna do like lights, like, lights-lights?

Trace: What?

Taylor: Did you wanna talk about light, like the use of lights like at night?

Trace: Oh, sure, yeah, that would be interesting.

Taylor: Well, that is interesting because Tucson had an observatory, I think it was from the University of Arizona. I'm not sure under what auspice it was. But there was an observatory up in the mountain south of Tucson in the Santa Rita Mountains, and it was called Kitt Peak. So, because a lot of light is not good for an observatory when they're trying to look at the planets, etc., we had lights in Tucson that were friendly, you know, that had covers over them so that we wouldn't have so much reflect light going up.

Trace: Oh, interesting.

Taylor: Yeah, it was kind of interesting.

Trace: So what happened? Is Kitt Peak still operational?

Taylor: I believe it is.

Trace: So, the city hasn't grown to the point where it's impossible to look at the stars?

Taylor: I don't think it has. I think they're careful.

Trace: So, how much do you think Tucson has grown since you moved there?

Taylor: Since I moved there?

Trace: Yeah, in '52 to today.

Taylor: Probably plus 400,000.

Trace: Grown by about 400...So, like, doubled?

Taylor: Oh yes.

Trace: Okay. But hasn't been growing as fast as Phoenix?

Taylor: No.

Trace: Okay.

Taylor: Interesting, huh?

Trace: Yeah. So, the dust storms today are only in Phoenix, they're not in Tucson?

Taylor: No, I haven't witnessed a dust storm in Tucson.

Trace: Okay. So, in terms of the temperature, do you think that Tucson still has such a large temperature drop at night?

Taylor: Yes.

Trace: Yes? Do you think the range of temperatures has shifted, even though the gap between day and night is still so large?

Taylor: Well, Tucson is still a desert. I mean, we don't...I don't know, that's a good question, we would have to look it up.

Trace: So, what about...Is it hotter today in Tucson than it was in '52 or '53?

Taylor: Yes.

Trace: Like 10 degrees hotter about?

Taylor: I think...Yes, I think they have more days that are 110.

Trace: They have days that are 110s?

Taylor: That's what my friends say.

Trace: So that's like over...that's a huge increase from the '50s?

Taylor: Well, yeah. But of course in the '50s we did have days that were 100, and now there's days that's 110. It's not like every day. You know what I'm saying? So, the more I say, I'd say that it has gone up because I remember Tato [SP] saying, you know, when it's 110, it's really hot, but not like Phoenix, of course, 121.

Trace: And then it still gets a lot cooler at night, but maybe it's 10 degrees cooler at night as well?

Taylor: Right, I'm sure. Not 10 degrees cooler, 10 degrees hotter at night.

Trace: Hotter?

Taylor: Yeah.

Trace: Do you think the monsoon season is the same today as it was when you moved?

Taylor: No, I don't think that it is. It doesn't come August. This year they had rain in...I think they had rain in October and they had some rain this winter, which is unusual.

Trace: So, it's happening later in the year basically?

Taylor: It seems like it is, instead of being in August. But then Phoenix had rain. You know, you just don't know. It did.

Trace: And so I'm guessing that it never snows in Tucson or it hasn't snowed for many years, is that right?

Taylor: That's correct.

Trace: So, no more snow? Do you think the higher elevations maybe have snow still?

Taylor: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure there was some snow, because I remember Tato saying it was really cold. And they... Probably some place in Tucson, like towards the foothills could have gotten snow.

Trace: But not the main city like it used to?

Taylor: No, because there wasn't that...People didn't live all over like they do now.

Trace: Maybe we could talk about water. Can you name, like, how the rivers changed since you first moved to Tucson?

Taylor: Well, in the history of Tucson long ago...I'm trying to think of how long ago. Maybe in the '30s, the '20s and the '30s, there was the...there was a river on the west side of Tucson and it did run. When I lived in Tucson, none of our rivers ran. Zip. Zero. The only time the rivers ran were and still it's that way. It's like those pictures in the movies when you have an arroyo and the water's just churning, because the water, it pours...when it rains, and it rains...if it rains a lot, the water all goes into the rivers and then the rivers are just like boiling. You know, just it's scary and people could...you could get washed away.

So, you know, that still happens when...you know, but we have to get the summer rains in order for that to happen. Or the rain sometimes in October we would...used to get rains like that.

Trace: So, it sounds like... Yeah?

Taylor: No, I mean... You know, I don't know because I wasn't there. I know this was a good year for Tucson, better than Denver. I know there was rain this winter in Tucson.

Trace: So, it sounds like the general monsoon pattern or rain filling up rivers, that pattern is still the same but maybe it just happens at different times of the year?

Taylor: At different times. And sometimes it doesn't happen at all. I mean, for some years I remember we waited for the monsoon because it's so hot in Tucson, that people, you know, they go away. They go to Southern California. If you can afford to go to Southern California.

Trace: So, anything else in terms of what Tucson used to look like and how it's changed over 40 years?

Taylor: You know how I think it has changed? That I really noticed more people don't have grass anymore. They don't. They don't have grass and they're trying to be conscientious people. And also it's the economics because it's so expensive. You know, water...

Trace: So, has water gotten more expensive?

Taylor: Yeah, water in Tucson, there's no...you know, there's no water. The City of Tucson, which Judy and I stop at Mary Alice [SP] and Gary's ranch, the ranchers north of Tucson for all these years since I was...since 1950 to now, the ranchers were always complaining because the City of Tucson would buy land and then the City of Tucson would put down wells for water for the city. And the ranchers wanted water for them, for their cotton because they grew pima cotton, and, you know, for their irrigation.

And so I don't know...I know my friend that was a rancher doesn't...they don't ranch anymore and now there's a subdivision close to where her...where we used to ride out into the scrub brush and the cattle would be grazing, if you can call it that.

Trace: So, the development has displaced a lot of the ranching operations it sounds like?

Taylor: Yes. And also the water because water was so...it is so expensive that it's prohibitive. If you're raising cotton, how much money can you get for your cotton, you know, when your water is so expensive?

Trace: So, now I'm supposed to ask you what are some of the things you used to do in Tucson. Maybe recreational activities.

Taylor: We always swam a lot, we swam a lot, we played tennis, but it was pretty hot, but we still played tennis. You know, we just did what kids do everywhere. You know, went to baseball games. You know, it's very hot in the summer.

Trace: That's why you swam, right?

Taylor: Yes. Yeah, swim there, it's completely different than here where kind of you swim but it's a little cool, in Tucson it's not. So we would go...you know, we'd go when...like in junior high and high school, and we would just swim all day.

Trace: Wow, that sounds so fun.

Taylor: At the Elks club.

Trace: At the Elks club, cool. So, I mean, maybe this question isn't that meaningful because, you know, you were a little kid and now you're a senior citizen, so you're maybe doing different activities. But I'm also supposed to ask, what do you do in Tucson now, and maybe how has the change that Tucson has undergone changed what you do in Tucson if at all?

Taylor: Well, lately I've been going to Tucson in April, and April is not the warmest month. And for the last two years that we've gone in April, we haven't...you know, when we used to go in May we would swim like all afternoon, but now it's too cool. I mean, April is just not a good month for us, the month that I go. But we have fun, we like go to the U of A and they're the same way...One of the ways Tucson has changed, which is really nice, is that they have a trolley that goes all the way from the University of Arizona, all the way to the other side of downtown and the other side of the freeway. So, it's really fun to take the trolley. And you can get off at any time and walk around. And Tucson is a really good walking city because it's nice, there's no ice and snow.

Trace: So even though it's gotten a lot warmer, it's...April is still too cold to swim?

Taylor: Right. I'll let you know after this year, maybe it can help you start swimming.

Trace: Okay. Anything else besides swimming? Is it too hot to go to baseball games, too hot to play tennis, too hot for...

Taylor: Well, right now it's... You know, of course, in the winter it's perfect. In the summer, you have to get up early if you wanna play tennis.

Trace: Was that always the case?

Taylor: Well, when the monsoon came...I mean, in Tucson if you wake up in the morning and it's cloudy in the summer, it's like a special day. It's very exciting. And so when those days come...I can still remember the day my friend taught me how to drive, even though I did take driver's ed, but she let me practice driving her car, and it was cool, it was just a cool morning. And it would be cloudy till noon and then, of course, the old sun would come out. So that's one reason that the people from Tucson like the monsoon.

And then the last time I was there in April, we did have those cloudy days, you know, and we walked. Because Tucson is an easy walking city because there...you know, there aren't any...there's no hills. I mean, there are when you get to the foothills, but in the city it's pretty flat. So you can walk a long way easily. So we walked and, you know, we had a great time.

And it's fun to see the architecture in Tucson because where we were, they had...Some of the architecture was left over from, gosh, before the 1950s, the adobe...we'd look at these adobe houses that were made out of real adobe bricks and...so, you know, we'd wish we could have one of those.

Trace: Any other activities that you like to do in Tucson currently?

Taylor: I like to eat. There's millions of Mexican restaurants. Delicious.

Trace: So, now I'm just gonna go through and summarize the...what we talked about and you can tell me if I got anything wrong or if there's anything you want to add. So, first we talked about what Tucson used to be like back in the '50s. It was small, no malls. We talked about Corbett Field...

Taylor: Oh, it's Hi Corbett Field.

Trace: Hi Corbett Field. Excuse me.

Taylor: Because the guy's name was Hi, H-I, Corbett, C-O-R-B-E-T-T.

Trace: Who was this guy?

Taylor: It was named after. The Corbetts were people who lived in Tucson forever.

Trace: We talked about the monsoon season, the temperature changes, precipitation, the observatory, and rivers. So then we talked about what Tucson is like today. It's grown a lot, the dust storms have gone away, the temperature has gone up, the monsoon season has sort of started to happen later in the year. Snow has become less prevalent, there's...citizens are trying to save water by not having grass. Water has gotten more expensive, development has pushed the ranchers out, and there's a nice trolley that was built from U of A, all over Tucson.

Taylor: No. Well, just to the downtown area, which prior to this, you know, when I was in school the U of A was really relatively small and we didn't have many activities west of campus. And now it's really a huge place where kids go, probably because...one of the reasons because the trolley gives those kids that don't have cars, which are quite a few of them, they just can get on the trolley and then they go down to South Forrest where there's a lot of bars.

Trace: So, the U of A has grown a lot too, that's another change that's happened?

Taylor: Yes, the U of A is huge.

Trace: So, I'll write that.

Taylor: I mean, U of A uses irrigation. So, to water their stalk [SP], say they have...like the way they do it, and this is how they do it in old Phoenix, they still do it today, they have like little hills...like you have a grass yard, and there's little hills on the edge of your grass yard. And so they fill up the grass...they fill up the yard, so the water doesn't flow in the street or flow in the sidewalk because it's just contained, and that's what...that's the old fashion way of watering. They open the gates, like at the U of A they open the water and then it goes out and they just fill up the area, then they turn it off, and then you water like that, you don't have to water that much, that many days.

Trace: And that still happens today?

Taylor: Yeah. Well, I think so.

Trace: Okay, interesting. So then finally we talked about what you used to do in Tucson, swimming, playing tennis, going to baseball games. And then we talked about what you do in Tucson now.

Taylor: Well, it's the same old things. We don't play tennis.

Trace: Same old things? Right.

Taylor: But next week we're gonna go to baseball because Queenie [SP] will be playing for the U of A hopefully.

Trace: Oh, that will be very exciting.

Taylor: It will be.

Trace: So, do you think you have any pictures of Tucson from when you first lived there?

Taylor: I used to, but I don't think I have now. I don't know where they would be.

Trace: Okay. Well, I'm supposed to ask you for one, and perhaps you can find one, and I will appreciate it and my classmates will appreciate it, but no worries if you...

Taylor: When do you have to have it, Trace?

Trace: Like the next few...This assignment is due on Monday, I think. So, like Saturday or Sunday will be fine. But don't spend a ton of time looking for it.

Taylor: I have a picture that I just looked at. Oh, it's in your home.

Trace: Oh, perfect.

Taylor: I can take a picture of it. It's me, [inaudible 00:31:26] yard, which you'll see how much of a desert it is. Wait, I know...I knew I saw that picture. Right at this moment looking at Forrest. Oh yeah, you get the whole idea.

Trace: Oh, that's so cool.

Taylor: Do you think if I take a picture of it downstairs, it will go?

Trace: Yeah. Yeah, your iPhone has a pretty good camera, I think it will be able to do a good job.

Taylor: How funny. And then they'll see how the [inaudible 00:32:00] the bushes. That's right when I moved to Tucson. So, that's really what you got basically because that was when our house was new. But they never got much bigger than that because it's so hard to grow stuff, and my mother really was a pretty good grower.

Trace: Cool. Well, thank you for thinking of that.

Taylor: Well, I just saw it the other day.

Trace: So, I have your email address, I think everybody is gonna post their interviews and I'll send you a link to the website in case you are interested. And I'm also supposed to ask you for your social media account if you would like me to help you post this interview on your social media account.

Taylor: Not especially because I don't use social media.

Trace: Not especially? Okay. Well, those are all the questions...

Taylor: You know, I'm old. I'm probably the oldest person that you will interview.

Trace: I doubt that very much.

Taylor: No, I think that's probably true.

Trace: Oh, there's definitely people in their 80s who are gonna...

Taylor: ...and then you can see my attire, and that's what people had to wear in the summer in Tucson because it was so hot.

Trace: Well, I look forward to seeing that. So those are all the questions I had, unless there's anything else notable you want to talk about.

Taylor: I think that is...I think that's good, Trace.

Trace: Okay.

Taylor: All right. So it's tracepitman@...tracepitman2?

Trace: It's pitman.trace2. Or what you could do, which might be easier, is just text it to me and then I'll email it to myself, if that's easier.

Taylor: No, I'll email it because that's what I do.

Trace: Okay. Cool. So thank you...

Taylor: So wait. pitman.trace2.

Trace: That's it.

Taylor: That's it?

Trace: Yeah, at gmail.com.

Taylor: Oh, well that helped. gmail.com. It'll gonna be coming really faster then you don't even want it. Okay, so if you follow the VIN number, I think you will...You know, maybe they'll say you're just in luck, you just got 9,000 [inaudible 00:34:34] air bags and then put one in your trunk.

Trace: Oh yeah, that would be nice. Unfortunately they don't have an appointment until May, so it's gonna be like three weeks before I can get it in.

Taylor: Well that's because...So you found the VIN number and everything?

Trace: Yeah, I know how to get it.

Taylor: Okay. And they're gonna fix it? They have them now?

Trace: Actually she didn't tell me that. She didn't tell me whether or not they could, she just said that she'll let the mechanic know or whatever.

Taylor: Okay. All right, Trace. Well, over...

Trace: Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.

Taylor: This has been one of the weirdest days for my going...I knew this morning that if I didn't go out early, that the trees could...you know, would start breaking. So that motivated me, but then I didn't get my pass. Oh well. It was so funny, you would have loved it.

Trace: Did you watch the basketball game last night?

Taylor: I watched every single second of it.

Trace: Give me the synopsis?

Taylor: Well, in the first half, Gonzaga [SP] was just fantastic. I mean, they were really good. The coach of South...no, North Carolina was just really upset. But then in the second-half the North... You know, those North Carolina players are big. Big-big-big. And they also know how to play basketball.

You know what? Did I tell you about the thing with Shawn Miller, what I thought? I think I did. A little girl...I think you missed the game. But in the game where the girl from Mississippi State beat UConn, there was a little player, the day before she scored 43 points and I think against UConn, she scored 41, and then when they played...who did they play for the final? One of the SCC schools.

Anyway, so then they go to play South Carolina or something for the...you know, for the championship. And I didn't think she was playing badly. She was nothing like Alonzo [inaudible 00:37:17]. Nothing. So, he took her out... Get this. He took her out at the end of the first half and he never put her back in.

Trace: What?

Taylor: No.

Trace: Why?

Taylor: I don't know. But you know what, Trace? That's what a good...that's what a coach does. I don't know, maybe the poor kid was just tired, she...you know, she's little. She's a sophomore and she's like 5'1", 5'2". So, she was...I think she was probably just exhausted and you know... I mean, the coach knows their players.

But my point is that he has enough guts, he's gonna have her for two more years. And, you know, to fix this so that whatever she was doing or, you know, not leaving them [inaudible 00:38:15], that she'll never do that again.

Trace: Wow, that is something.

Taylor: Yeah. So when you play for Shawn Miller, it doesn't matter because you know he'll just take you back.

Trace: I told Devin [SP] that he needs to take out Tria [SP].

Taylor: He does.

Trace: And it's like...it's one thing when the player is actually being selfish in scoring. But when the player is being selfish and missing every shot, that's just inexcusable.

Taylor: Yeah, it was. Because you know what? And the thing is...this is what I think in terms of [inaudible 00:38:50]. I think that Colby Simmons [SP] is gonna leave. I don't know... He won't like sitting out for a year. So that would be the only thing. But he'll either try in the NBA, which he should not do, or transfer.

Taylor: Yes, you know that plan. So, I don't know.

Trace: Well, I got my mission set today and I am ready to send in the check that you wrote for my registration renewal.

Taylor: Perfect.

Trace: So, thank you for that.

Taylor: You're very welcome.

Trace: And yeah.

Taylor: Okay, Trace. Well, I love you and I will now take my shower.

Trace: I love you too. Have a good rest of your...
