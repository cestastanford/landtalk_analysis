Interviewee: Okay.

Interviewer: Great. Testing, testing. Can you hear my voice?

Interviewee: I can.

Interviewer: Great. I hope that the inter-recorder can also hear my voice.

Interviewee: I'm sure it can.

Interviewer: Great. Well, I'm really grateful that you are doing this interview with me. And tell me a little bit about the particular place that you've been living for the past 20 or so years.

Interviewee: For about the last 20 years, I've been a resident of Bend, Oregon. A part of that time, I've lived up on Aubrey. A part of that time, I lived up on the most western part of it right against the wilderness.

Interviewer: Tell me a little bit about that place. What could you see from your house?

Interviewee: Well, we had a reverse living condition. And from it, you could look out and you can see the whole mountain range. You could see the whole area where the Aubrey fire went through back in 1990 and burned it out. So most of the trees were gone. It was all just meadow kind of area, and then it went up against the forest about half a mile out.

Interviewer: And when you think about the past 20 or so years when you, maybe, first moved to that place compared to now, how has that area changed for example, landscape, weather, plants, animals, anything that you've noticed the change in over time.

Interviewee: So this is kind of interesting because I think the first thing that comes to mind are the coyotes. It used to be that the coyotes would come in pretty close and you would hear them yelping. It sounded like a bunch of high school students having a roaring old time. And you'd think who's out there doing that? And then, you'd realize, no, it's the coyotes. So they would come in pretty close. There were hawks that would go in that area, fly around looking for prey. And we'd see a lot of deer coming through.

Interviewer: And has that changed over time?

Interviewee: Yeah. What happened was Tetherow, a whole golf course development went in. We still had like a 100-yard buffer before that came in. But when it came in, they started building small vacation rental houses and a large hotel and a giant golf course and then other houses started to be developed and put in all throughout that area.

Interviewer: How did you feel when that happened?

Interviewee: Well, kind of interesting because as it started out it hit in the recession. They started into it and then the recession hit. And so that really stunted development for quite a long time. They finally put in roads, but those sat undeveloped for a long period of time. And then as houses came in, as the golf course came in, as the hotels came in, as further development came in, the coyotes stayed further out. You didn't hear them but on a long distance. The deer didn't come through quite as much. And the area that was previously used by hawks to hunt vermin was pretty much developed and not there and available.

That's also interesting because the trees, part of the trees on the Aubrey fire just outside of their house started to grow. And when we were first ended up there, they were just really small, almost like sprouts. But nowadays, they're 15 to 20 feet high. And so in another few years, they'll start to block the view of the area. But just the whole area out there was... Now, it's golf courses instead of sagebrush and other types of things.

Interviewer: So what are some of the things that you used to do out there?

Interviewee: Go biking. We'd go across the fields out to the forest to go biking. Just go out adventuring, go out for walks, long walks in the area. There's a ridge, a nice biking ridge around there. You just watch rainbows and sunsets and the weather, big storms coming in out of the mountains.

Interviewer: And what are some of the things you do there now or what has changed about what you can do there?

Interviewee: Yeah, not so much, I guess if you want to golf it's certainly a beautiful golf course. You can still go on walks but it's on roads rather than trails. You can bike through there, but you're just biking through the roads to get on the other side of the development so you could hit the forest and go biking in the forest. It's more of a developed community or starting to become a developed community. You could rent a rental if you wanted to or you could stay at the hotel. But neither those things that we've done or have any desire to do because we live here.

Interviewer: So overall if you were to look at beyond just that area but how Bend has changed, how the landscape, the nature, the animals, what's changed over the past two decades or so, what would you say is the biggest difference?

Interviewee: Well, it's grown up and there's been a lot more land developed and the development where it previously had been spaced apart quite a bit more. And the wildlife would meander throughout the different places. Now, it's sort of cookie-cutter homes, very close together, 10 feet, 5 feet on either side. With the fences and all, there's just no room... There's no way that the wildlife can get in and around. Now, what happens is the squirrels run along tops of fence lines, but they have fewer trees to collect food from because they were knocked down and the house was built.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you so much for your time.

Interviewee: Sure.

Interviewer: I look forward to visiting Bend again to see these changes.

Interviewee: Okay. Well, pleasure to share that with you.

Interviewer: Thank you.

Interviewee: All right.

Interviewer: All right. Bye.
