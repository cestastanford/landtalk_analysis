Interviewer: Okay, Maurice, so my first question is when did you first move to San Mateo, California?

Maurice: 1975.

Interviewer: And what did the area of San Mateo look like in 1975? 

Maurice: Well, in the residential area it's quite a bit the same except that ranch houses suddenly have become larger with homeowners putting a second story on. In the area where there were small businesses, say a one-story Kmart suddenly that's torn down and we've got a building going up that might have 50 units, some residential and some commercial. So it's a different look to the town.

Interviewer: Definitely. And what are the main changes that you've noticed with the land in San Mateo and throughout the entire Bay Area as you've lived, as you're very familiar with the area over the past 40-something years?

Maurice: There seems to be a need to increase the number of residences. Interestingly, a close to mine good friend, a gentleman, bought two older homes and he wants to put up a 28-unit condominium with underground parking and things like this are passing in the city council meetings because of the impact on tax revenue. The more the town builds, the more tax money the local government has.

Interviewer: And as a result, have you seen the destruction of a lot of nature and natural areas due to all of the increased construction?

Maurice: Actually, I haven't noticed that at all. Most of the changes are these large commercial buildings and their built right out to the sidewalk or the curb so there really isn't much room to enhance the property.

Interviewer: Very good. Well, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you doing this interview.

Maurice: Oh, I enjoyed it. Thank you. Good luck.
