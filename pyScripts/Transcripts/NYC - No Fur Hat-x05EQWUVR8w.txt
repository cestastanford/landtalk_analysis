Interviewee: So we're talking in New York City. I grew up in New Jersey. And I'm here for a meeting this weekend in February, and every time I've been in New York as a Jersey native in the winter, in February, it's been freezing. It's never been 60 degrees ever. It is totally weird. 

Interviewer: How does it feel?

Interviewee: Well, I came out here this weekend, I brought my fur hat because I thought it was gonna be freezing. And I'm boiling, so I feel hot. But not, like, hot, hot. I'm warm. I feel warm.

Interviewer: What are you gonna do with the fur hat?

Interviewee: It's in my hotel room, in my suitcase.

Interviewer: So, next time you come to New York in February, it's gonna stay at home?

Interviewee: The next time, I'll check The Weather Channel before I come out here, and not drag so much stuff.

Interviewer: Okay, thanks.
