Interviewer: Okay. So, I am interviewing my sister-in-law, Alexandria. And the place that we're gonna talk about is Beale Street. And then the main topic is "How has Beale Street changed over the 20-year interval?" So, Alex, has Beale Street always had everything that is on that street?

Alexandria: No. They've changed a few things, like, the buildings of the homes or the apartment buildings. As far as like, The Charlie, The Charlie has changed. It's like a bus now. There are a lot more attractions as far as like bars and food places, where it was like gift shops and how to make money in Memphis, I guess.

Interviewer: Okay. So, do you enjoy going on Beale Street? Have you always enjoyed going on Beale Street?

Alexandria: Yes. It's where you meet a lot of different people. Thereâ€™s a good tourist site where you can meet a lot of the different people from a lot of different places. It just has a lot of Memphis history as far as like the music goes, and the building up of downtown.

Interviewer: Okay. So, when did you start to notice that Beale Street changed for the better?

Alexandria: I guess around the 2000s when the basketball teams came into play. I guess, in the 2000s, I could guess.

Interviewer: So, are you referring to like the Memphis Grizzlies basketball team?

Alexandria: Yeah, the Memphis Grizzlies, the University of Memphis Tigers, the FedExForum. Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. So, you said that the year that Beale Street started to become better was basically like the 2000s?

Alexandria: Mm-hmm, yeah.

Interviewer: As a child, what are some things that you used to do on Beale Street?

Alexandria: I remember going... an ice cream mobile. Just walking around seeing all the different sites and just meeting new people, seeing all the dancers on the street, the different people, the performers. Just seeing different people on Beale Street. 

Interviewer: So, what are some things that you do now on Beale Street compared to your childhood?

Alexandria: Well, I guess I would say I pay more attention to the history of Beale. Like, I could actually understand how much it's been built up and how big of a part of Memphis it is. And how important it is for Memphis, because that's where a lot of tourists go.

Interviewer: And B.B. King, I heard that that's on Beale Street. Can you kinda talk about that a little bit? Like, how does that help with, like, the music? How does that compare to the music?

Alexandria: Right. Because B.B. King, he's a blues singer. So he's a very intricate part of Memphis as well. And for us to have like a... I think it's a restaurant, a bar place. So, for us to have that and, you know, tourists can come and see it, it plays a big part as we grew up. The food is good.

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. Have you ever contributed to Beale Street in any way? Like, maybe participated in any downtown parade or watched a downtown parade? Or just volunteered to help around Beale Street area in the community, participate in the FedExForum, or anything? 

Alexandria: Actually, we did. In elementary school, we had like an event downtown, at their park. So, I guess, I don't know if we were cleaning up the park or we had some type of event. But yeah, I would say I remember that.

Interviewer: Okay. What used to be there that isn't there now? Or what wasn't there then but is now? 

Alexandria: Silky O'Sullivan's has always been there. Silky Sullivan's.

Interviewer: What is that?

Alexandria: It's like a little bar, food place. You just go, you know, hang out with your friends. What else is there? It's a lot more hangout places. Coyote Ugly is down there. The Memphis Queen, that's down there. They still have the boats. You can go sightsee the Mississippi river on the boats. The Charlie, that's always been there, but it's not the Charlie anymore. Different developments, like the Crosstown Commons, The Tennessee Brewery Building when the brewery factory was down there. So, it's been a lot of changes. They're building up more houses and more apartments.

Interviewer: So, do you think that it's changed for the better...

Alexandria: Definitely.

Interviewer: ...and it's a good change?

Alexandria: Definitely. It's definitely changed for the better. It's definitely changed for the better. Yeah.
