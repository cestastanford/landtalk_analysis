Interviewer: This is a Land Talk with, could you introduce yourself?

Brandon: Brandon Hall.

Interviewer: Cool. So, I was gonna ask you a few questions about the place you used to live for at least 20 years. So, what do you remember from when you first moved there?

Brandon: Well, I was born there, so when I  first moved there, I don't remember very much at all, actually. 

Interviewer: Okay. Okay. So what was your favorite part about living there?

Brandon: Lot's of sunshine and palm trees, now that I'm in the Midwest, so that was definitely one of the things.

Interviewer: Could you think of, like, an example o,f like, something you did outside or, like a good time you remember, like, with the palm trees or sunshine?

Brandon: Going to the beach. So, as far as being in an environment you always traveled to the beach from where you lived. But yeah, you know, sunshine.

Interviewer: Cool.  All right. So, from your childhood, do you have something, like, how you remember it used to look like versus how it looked when you were more of a teenager? Or did you notice anything that would have changed?

Brandon: That's kind of hard to say because Los Angeles is pretty built out. So, there wasn't much room for change, other than, like, the man-made structures. You know, buildings would get taller, get torn down, turned into a parking lot or whatever. The environment, it's really the man-made environment that kind of changed, not really the parks and stuff. But I would say the beaches got a little dirtier, a little messier. That's about it. That's all I can really think of.

Interviewer: Do remember any animals that, like, you would have seen at a younger age versus when you were, again, more of an adult? So, even like teenager to adult?


Brandon: Animals that went away?

Interviewer: Yeah. Or something you saw less of.

Brandon: It's weird. Again, LA is a very urban environment. So, there were animals that started showing up more. I know, at our high school that we had a real problem with seagulls. They would go farther and farther inland because they found that high school outdoor...Because, unlike the Midwest, a lot of our eating space is outside. And so, I think the animals started to learn, "Oh, there's this place where there's food all over the ground." So, we had a real problem with seagulls. And actually, we started having coyotes in our neighborhood. So, those animals actually kind of just adapting. They have probably left and they were coming back. So, I wouldn't say less of. I do know that while I was living out there, the California condor, like, it was becoming, like, the extremely endangered species. So, but they were already endangered when I was there, so I didn't really see any.

Interviewer: All right. To go off of, like, the wildlife and plants, do you remember any big storms or, like, climate changing? Like, around rainfall, or...

Brandon: I know we were in a drought for, like, 15 years, so not really changing. But we didn't have anything like tornadoes. Yeah, we don't have tornadoes. And, like, every time it rained, it was a flash flood because we just don't have any ground to absorb it. It's all concrete. So, no big storms. We don't...On the West Coast, we didn't get hurricanes. We didn't get tornadoes. We got wildfires. I don't know if that changed, because we had fire season, like, every year. I know we had a really bad one, like, in 2008 or 2009, where some homes get burned. And I know that since I've lived out here in the Midwest, they had one that was real bad that burned some expensive homes in Malibi, I think, or something like that. But maybe that's gotten worse.

Interviewer: Yeah. So, anything you remember... These are kind of, like, sporadic and, like, bad. But, anything you remember doing more of, like, as a kid outside versus less, like, because of the building up and out? Or was it, like, mostly concrete the whole 20 years?

Brandon: That's kind of a tough question to answer. Just given the theme of the questions. I know I rode my bike less, but I don't think it was because of anything other than I got older and started driving. So, you were a lot cooler if you drove in high school than if you rode your bike to high school. I know that the wildfires would make the air quality really bad for people. So, we weren't allowed to play at recess, or our football practice and stuff would get canceled. I don't know that every year people, you know, with asthma would have to stay indoors because it was really bad for them. But, I don't think being outside was much of a...It didn't really change for me.

Interviewer: Okay. All right. Well, thank you for your time.

Brandon: Sure.

Interviewer: Yeah. Cool. Thank you.
