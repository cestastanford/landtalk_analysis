Interviewer: Okay. So this is my mom. She grew up in Ry [SP] which is a college campus in Beijing, and that was in 1960s, so, more than 50 years ago. And she does still go back from time to time to visit her family who still lives there, so she's very familiar with the area. So my first question is, how would you describe how the place used to look?

Interviewee: Used to look? It used to look a lot different from now, in the past. I remember when I was growing up, on the campus there were less buildings, and there are, I mean, just physical appearance-wise there were less buildings, and there were a lot of land, there were more trees. I remember I used to climb up the trees, now, a lot of the land was used for buildings because there are more and more college students, and more and more facilities developed.

Interviewer: So, what was it like, maybe like the landscape back then? Like what kind of trees and plants?

Interviewee: Good question.

Interviewer: Like the willow tree.

Interviewee: Yeah, there's...Oh, yeah, good question. Now there's not a single willow tree. It used to be like, you know, the big field with the running tracks, all willow trees lined around it. And very pretty. And there were also, there was a garden, orchard actually, where there were apples, and pears, and walnuts trees, and dates trees there that actually in the fall we used to go there and try to do a little of harvest.

Interviewer: So, all those trees are gone?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewee: It's all buildings?

Interviewer: Yeah. And there used to be outdoor swimming pool. Yeah, all those place, land, are used for buildings.

Interviewer: So, you'd say, I guess just most of the landscape has been turned into construction?

Interviewee: Yeah. And also right now it's a lot cleaner. It's actually a lot prettier because the new buildings have been constructed with modern materials, and the college campus has had more budget, so it has been able to put some, you know, fancy looking materials, and landscape pretty well. There are some traditional Chinese buildings set up, there are some benches along the road, and they planted a lot of plants like roses along the road. So, yeah, it still looks pretty.

Interviewer: So, what things did you used to do there? I know you used to like collect cicadas and chase dragonflies.

Interviewee: Yes, we used to have so much free time. You know, during the culture revolution, it was chaotic, it wasn't good for the country, but for kids, it could be fun because we did not have homework to do, and we had so much free time. So, every day after school just groups of us would go out and hang out together round every corner on campus. Sometime climb up tall building now I think it was pretty dangerous. There was a place, one of the tallest building, no guard, security, so we used to actually climb up to the roof and look down.

Interviewer: What about like the nature things? Like you said collect harvest or fruit harvest.

Interviewee: Yeah, the natures things, yes. So, I remember there also a patch of sweet potatoes, for some reason, I wasn't sure why the patch was there. So we sometimes, you know, we would go there and we would go into the trees, into the orchard, yeah, just to play hide and seek. Sometimes we used simple materials to do play house, you know, when kids play, pretend they're having a house, like we would use a piece of rock or something, pretend it's a bowl, or pretend it is a chair, something like that.

Interviewer: What about like all the dragonflies too?

Interviewee: That was during the summer, there's more things to do. So, yeah, we'll chase dragonflies and butterflies, and pick up the, what's that the word?

Interviewer: Cicadas.

Interviewee: Yeah. In the evening.

Interviewer: So, nowadays, when you go, like, what kind of things can you do outdoors?

Interviewee: So, you know, we sometime even climb up trees, and climb trees, and pretty much most things we do is outdoor. Like when we'd play house, we do outdoor, oh, we do a lot of simple games using a rope, you know, a group will be...

Interviewer: I'm saying, when you go back now, like when you just went back.

Interviewee: Oh, go back now?

Interviewer: Yeah, what kind of outdoor things can you do nowadays?

Interviewee: On campus?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: On the campus? Well, I'm a different age now, so, pretty much just walking, and, you know, on the play field we would go there and use the simple equipments there, fitness equipments there.

Interviewer: I thought they got rid of that.

Interviewee: Yeah, that part was taken away, but on the field there are still some simple things.

Interviewer: So, less like fields to play on, mainly like walking paths?

Interviewee: Yeah, I would say more of structured things to do now. Like, if I take a walk, I walk in the field and track field instead of venture out into the trees and do. I think when I was growing up, there used to be more unstructured activities for a case. Now it's more of a structured.

Interviewer: Yeah, it seems like all the places that you can play on nowadays are all developed?

Interviewee: Yeah. Not too much like free play, and of course there are less kids there. I hardly see any kids playing outside now. There are less kids, and more kids are doing more things at home, like maybe doing homework or learning something.

Interviewer: Okay. That was all the questions I had.

Interviewee: Really? Okay. Just those physical things?

Interviewer: Yeah. Just about how the like ecology of the place changed.

Interviewee: Ecology.

Interviewer: Like nature stuff.

Interviewee: I mean, people change the landscape, it did not change naturally, right? Like people turned the land into buildings, and made it to try to make it a prettier and cleaner.

Interviewer: I haven't been there in a while.

Interviewee: Yeah. There are some changes, there are some buildings that are even taller now than the last time you were there.

Interviewer: Well, the last time I was there they still had the exercise, didn't they? Do they still have that old exercise place?

Interviewee: Oh yeah, they moved the tennis courts also, which makes sense. They moved the tennis courts and basketball courts next to the big field, so, that makes sense, right?So they're together. Used to be the tennis courts were a separate place.

Interviewer: That's all the questions I had.

Interviewee: Okay. I think the harder questions, those are easy.

Interviewer: No. They are easy, yes. Thank you for...

Interviewee: I like this interactive.

Interviewer: Thank you for taking place in this interview. I will publish this video and you can see it online.

Interviewee: Oh, thank you. I'll see it online?

Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

Interviewee: Thank you for giving me this opportunity to think back of my happy childhood.

Interviewer: Yeah. Bye-bye.

Interviewee: Okay. Bye-bye.
