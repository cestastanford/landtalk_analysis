Interviewer: Okay. So we'll be talking about Beijing and how it changed in the past 20 years. Could you tell me and describe the way the place used to look?

Interviewee: Yeah. Before we moved to the United States, I lived in Beijing and my house was very close to Beijing Drum Tower. My house was located at a street that's very close to Beijing Drum Tower. The house was...the name is siheyuan. The siheyuan, this house is a historical type of residence that was commonly found in Beijing. And so, the siheyuan like a square and, each side, build several room. That means a courtyard. And at the meantime, the street was very narrow and then, after I think 2008, the houses were demolition. They expanded the street.

Interviewer: So the street, now it's wider?

Interviewee: So, right now the street are wider and I think right now it's, like, four lines.

Interviewer: Four lanes?

Interviewee: Uh-huh, yeah. It's not like before; it's just a two-line. And they expand the street because for preparing 2008 Beijing Olympic. 

Interviewer: Interesting. Okay, so the building that you used to live in was demolished?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. I see. So they rebuilt more residences for the Olympics?

Interviewee: They just made the street more wider and let the residence relocate to a countryside. It's far from the center of Beijing, you know, [crosstalk 00:03:09] city.

Interviewer: Oh, okay.

Interviewee: Yeah, they moved very far from the center.

Interviewer: Oh, okay, so they didn't rebuild any new buildings. They just made the streets wider.

Interviewee: You're right. Because in that street, there are lots of people over there and they cannot build any building there because they want expand the street wider. So they just build new building in the countryside. Very I think maybe 20 miles from what we live. They build very tall building over there, a lot of buildings over there.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. I see. And this is where you used to live?

Interviewee: Yes. Yeah, I had been there for I think 27 years and then I moved to United States.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. So, what kinds of things did you used to do there in the area?

Interviewee: So, when I was little or very young, we just find a bus from my house to very south of Beijing or go to Wangfujing shopping center. And sometimes, during the summertime, we just went to the moat [inaudible 00:05:12]. Yeah, city moat during the summertime because, at the meantime, we have no any airconditioner in Beijing so the summertime, it was very hot then. After work, one week...we come back from work. Then, after dinner, we just have a walk to the moat and then maybe feel a little bit cool, you know?

Interviewer: Oh, okay. So, I know you don't live there anymore, but in recent years, when you've been back in the area, what did you do? Did you do anything differently?

Interviewee: So, right now they built a subway over there. There are two subway. One is Line 6; another is Line 2. That's two subways in that area. It's very convenient. And also they have a farmers' market just north of my house and a very big farmers' market so there are a lot of, like, vegetables and fruit. And I think lots of people go there shopping for their food. Yeah, they're a very good store. It's covered. The farmers' market is covered. It's not like an open area. It's very good.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. This farmers' market wasn't there when you were young?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. Okay, I think that's it. Thank you so much for speaking to me about this.

Interviewee: You're welcome.
