Man: ...same townhouse for like 16 years. Obviously that's, like, my beginning point for that question. Is that all right? 

Interviewer: Yeah, that's okay. So...

Man: It's not quite 20, but close enough. 

Interviewer: So [inaudible 00:00:37] the townhouse where you lived? 

Man: I mean, it's very similar to what it is. 

Interviewer: It's similar? 

Man: Yeah. We've had a lot of different neighbors move in and out, but the actual, like, way it looks from your eye is, you know...some trees have been cut down that used to be there. They got into some people's, like, plumbing and stuff so they cut them down. 

Interviewer: Oh, really? Like the roots?

Man: Yeah. Like, my wife, but she...every year or so we have to pay someone to, like, get the roots out because we don't want to cut the tree down so we just do that. Because some people just get fed up and cut the tree down. 

Interviewer: So the just cut it down...

Man: Yeah, because everyone has one big tree in their yard in their townhouse here, but, like, half of them have been cut down because they didn't, I guess, plan out how far the roots would go and get into the pipes and stuff. 

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. So any activities that you used to do that...do you still do it? 

Man: That I did back then that I still do? Yeah, I mean, where we is it's, like, different villages and they're connected by these different walking paths. And so I've taken advantage of that since I've moved there. 

Interviewer: Have the walking parks changed? Like have anything new been added? 

Man: Well they, like, updated some of the playgrounds along the walk. Some of them were getting pretty old and had some dangerous slides in them. Like, steel metal slides, you know?

Interviewer: Oh, like, they can't really [inaudible 00:02:11]

Man: There's no, like, staging area, like, to get situated, you know? And now they put, like, a wooden one with those whole, like, area, you know, to get down the slide. So along the walking paths, like, three or four of the playgrounds have now been replaced over that period of time, you know. 

Interviewer: Okay.

Man: The college, we live right next to the Howard County Community College.

Interviewer: Oh, you do? 

Man: Like, the back entrance to it. So that has been growing a lot over the past 15 years. So I definitely notice more students around the parking, or sometimes even living, renting out townhouses in the area. So that has been one change, it's like right across the street from where the road, you turn left into the street or even turn right into the back entrance to the Howard County Community College.

Interviewer: Have new stores been popping up since more students are moving in? 

Man: Not too much. Columbia is really regulated as far as how much they allow stores, and where they can build, like, regulations, you know. People aren't allowed to put up, like, big huge signs, like, there's no McDonald's arches or anything. It's all regulated because it's a planned community, they planned it out. It's the first one in the country, so the roads are along, like, natural, whatever, the way they would go, the way rivers go or something. 

Interviewer: So you have a very scenic area? 

Man: Yeah, it's nice. It's good for kids. And we have, like, a community pool. So we don't have our own pool, obviously, but there's one that's, like, a six minute walk... 

Interviewer: Oh, wow. 

Man: ...from where we live so we don't have to drive, we just cut through this path and then we're there.
