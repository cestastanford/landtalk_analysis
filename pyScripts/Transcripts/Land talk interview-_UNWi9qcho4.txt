Paola: Okay, so my name is Paola Raez [SP] and today I'm going to be doing an interview. We're basically gonna be interviewing you about the place you've been living at for more than 20 years, and how the surroundings have changed over time. 

Pedro: Hi, Paola. My name is Pedro Raez. I'm 51 years old. I've been living in Mount Rainier for more than 20 years. 

Paola:  All right, so how was the environment like 20 years ago? 

Pedro: The environment was a little bit different. It was not storms like now, it's, like, we lost a lot of trees before last year and a lot of more trees now. I see a lot of trees fell down because of the storms. And also it's raining less than before. 

Paola:  What do you think caused these changes? 

Pedro: I believe the climate is changing because of all the pollution, a lot of...more technology, more contamination going through the air, and that's what caused the climate change. 

Paola:  So new technology is just overtaking. So what would you say about changes in terms of construction? Has there been a lot of construction going around? 

Pedro: Oh, yes. Most of the house been remodeled and now you can see they keep the same style of the house, but if you see they have been updating the house with the new technology too. And here it's like changing everything inside and outside. It looked like more a new neighborhood now. 

Paola:  Would you say there's more people or less people? 

Pedro: It might be a little more people because the new families being move into the area. You can see now more kids than before. I used to see more older people, but now I see new families move into the area. 

Paola:  So you see a lot more children now than before? 

Pedro: Yep. Yes, definitely. And then now I see a lot too, a lot more pets they're walking on the street. 

Paola:  Oh, pets. 

Pedro: Yeah.

Paola:  And how about the activities before? What were some activities that was in the area before? 

Pedro: I don't see a lot of activities. Basically you don't see much activities before. Now I can see more activities like more people walking on the street, younger people, you know, with a pet walking around in the neighborhood. 

Paola:  Oh, so more pets, and a lot more people walking outside than in the past...

Pedro: Right.

Paola:  ...when you first got there. 

Pedro: Yes, yes. 

Paola:  So do you know any other changes, like, for example anything that's caused more constructions in terms of stores and...

Pedro: Yes, it's like on the closer shopping centers here it's, like, either building new restaurants, new store, new supermarkets. Yes, yes, there's new stores and yeah, it's been changing. And I see some buildings, new buildings around too, apartment buildings. 

Paola:  And overall do you think the changes were for the better or for the worst? 

Pedro: I think for the better. It's like I can see the old D.C. area has been growing and peoples moving close to the D.C. Area.

Paola:  Oh, since...

Pedro: You can see it's been growing since, from 15 years to now. 

Paola:  Yeah, since you live around the border of D.C. and Maryland you get to experience both sides.

Pedro: Right. And what I see is that the new families try to find a place to live close to D.C. area because the opportunities are in D.C., and maybe there's a new people and they are looking for new opportunities.

Paola:  All right. So this concludes our interview. Thank you so much for participating. 

Pedro: Okay, no problem Paola.
