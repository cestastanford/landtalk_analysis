Interviewer: All right. Can you just begin by introducing yourself and saying where we will talk about today?

Ina: Sure. My name is Ina Coleman. And I live in Los Angeles. I was born in Los Angeles. And I'll be talking today about life in Los Angeles, growing up, comparing it from the past to now.

Interviewer: Great. So, can you begin just by talking about what it was like when you were growing up, maybe just things you witnessed around you.

Ina: Yeah, sure. So, I was born in Los Angeles in 1959. So, obviously lived there in the '60s and '70s. And comparing it, life back then was like any other city where, you know, downtown Los Angeles had the tallest buildings of any other office buildings in Los Angeles. And, for example, the tallest building, other places was 25 floors, but in Los Angeles downtown those buildings were 50 floors. And so, that's what stood out to me, is that downtown had the tallest buildings, that's no longer the case today. And back then, '60s and '70s, there were still a lot of open land and open acreage, even though it was a dense urban area.

You were able to buy Christmas tree lots several places, pumpkin patch plots several places. When I grew up, down the street from me, there actually was an open lot and acreage where there was pony rides and carnivals, and I would ride a pony when I was 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 years old. It is now called the Beverly Center, which is one of the major malls in Los Angeles. And also, back then, which remains today are, you know, some beautiful parks in Los Angeles, Griffith Park, and there's also the Los Angeles Reservoir, which is in Los Ayllus [SP]. 

And the venues back then that are still exist today, the Hollywood Bowl, the Greek theater, and those were still, those were where people would go, and the communities would gather for events or activities. And, again, there was lots of different open spaces where people would go do things, but that no longer is pretty much no more. None of the open lots and spaces today.

Interviewer: Thank you. So, would you say like some of the historical activities you used to do were like, there's pony rides, or, like what did you do in your free time in Los Angeles mostly?

Ina: Right. So, back then, I'm thinking the 1960s and '70s, some of the historical activities that my family and I did was going to Griffith Park Observatory, and up in Griffith Park which is this beautiful park in the northern hills, Los Angeles. They also had an area for trains. And so, oftentimes back then, and also still today, I think the trains are still up there, or they are retired trains. A lot of families would go over there and have birthday parties, get their kids just go up and to play around and see what it was like to be on a train. I think that still exists today.

Historical activities I also did back then was go to museums, particularly an area called Exposition Park, which is pretty much the same, but what's different is that they have upgraded a lot of the museums that were there. Like there's the African American Museum that's newly built in the last 20 years there, and other science museums that it's called the California Science Center that was built 20 years ago. So, the whole museum area Griffith Park, I mean, at Exposition Park that I went to when I was a kid, it's still there, but, you know, the facilities are upgraded, which is typical of a city. And my family and I would go to Santa Monica beach, that was really something very special when I was, you know, 15, 14 years old, was to be able to get in the car and just go to Santa Monica Beach.

And The Forum was the place, the Los Angeles Forum was a place where you would go to events, athletic events, and concerts, and any kind of kid's concert. Today it's STAPLES Center, not very much is held, the Forum doesn't really have those kind of activities anymore. And, lastly, there was something called Angels Flight Railway, it was a funicular railway that just went up and down this rail. And I vividly remember going on that when I was a kid and it was really fun because it was special. It broke down, gotten disrepair, was closed for about 20 years, and it just opened back up in 2015. And those are some of the historical activities.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you. And so, generally, what would you say are some of the changes you witnessed over time to Los Angeles?

Ina: Right. Well, the changes are typical of really any other city. Where the city has grown up and out. And there are newer facilities being built to replace the aging facilities for a growing population. Like I mentioned before, when I was growing in '60s and '70s, there was open land and acreage, and that no longer or it's getting less and less and there's very little open land or acreage in a dense city area where you can have Christmas tree lots or pumpkin patches. So to be honest, I don't even know where my grandchildren would go to buy that, buy a Christmas tree or pumpkin patch in 20 years because I don't think...I think you'll have to drive hours to go by a Christmas tree. That's my fear.

What else has changed is just...and again, typical of most cities, more malls, large malls, mini malls, where you drive in, there's no place to park, but there's tons of little stores. Increasing event facilities like STAPLES Center, and the, I guess Nokia Center, LA Live. Hotels, the number of hotels has just really increased. The hospitals and medical facilities have gotten, which is a good thing, they're bigger and they're more expansive. And same thing with restaurants. And public transportation. You know, LA, unlike New York, didn't plan for public transportation for subway. So they're trying to retrofit a subway in a city which has been quite a challenge. But, it's great to see that public transportation is being dealt with and addressed, more buses, adding metros here and there. So, yeah, those are some of the changes that I've seen.

Interviewer: Have you witnessed any change to like weather or some of the other natural sort of things in that Los Angeles environment?

Ina: Yes. So, as far as weather, I have not witnessed any change in the weather. I mean, the change has been what everybody else is experiencing, so global warming. It's a lot hotter and a lot warmer. I mean, now in the summers, it can get to 100, like, it can get to like 90s in the city. Whereas, when I was growing up, you would only have that heat in Palm Springs, the desert, but because of global warming, I have seen a change in the natural habitat of animals in Los Angeles.

The Coyotes are coming down more from the hills because they're being chased out by development of new homes being built in the hills and they sort of don't have anywhere to go, and because of that, they're hungry. So they're coming down into the city, and over the last 10 years, more and more coyotes are coming down and sort of hanging out in front of people's homes and eating people's little animals, eating their dogs. And one coyote almost attacked a toddler five years ago. So, it's been quite a change in how some of the animals that are up in the hills, how their habitat has changed because of a growing city and development. They're hungry.

Interviewer: And final question. So, you talked about some of the things you used to do back in Los Angeles. Have those relatively like stayed the same, or what are some of the current things that you do or that you think people generally do there?

Ina: Right. So, the things I do now. So I think that...so the good news, and you're asking these questions and having me think about it. A lot of things have stayed the same, which is great. The Hollywood Bowl, Greek theater, Griffith Park, the reservoirs, hiking. So, there's still those places where you can go hike and enjoy the environment. So, that's wonderful that stayed the same. What's different is, some of the newer facilities for athletic events, like the STAPLES Center was built, I don't know, 20 years ago. 

And also what's different is, there is a way to bicycle more around. I mean, they've added bike lanes sort of. And I want to address that as far as infrastructure, because I don't see how you just, by just painting a bicycle on a street, how it's a bike lane. And there's been a real problem of bicyclists and cars in Los Angeles cohabitating on the same streets. And there's been an increase in the number of bicyclists that have been killed because of that. I think the city has not done a very good job of trying to figure out or educate bicyclists on cars and cars on bicyclists. So, it's a huge problem, and they just sort of threw bicyclists and cars together and there's been horrible results from it.

So, I like the fact that they've added bike lanes everywhere, and you can bike anywhere because of having like bicycle in the lane, but it's not really a real true infrastructure because they haven't done anything to incorporate bikes along with all of the traffic and all the cars. And it's a real problem. So, to be honest, I would like to bike but I don't because I'm scared I'm gonna get hit by a car.

Interviewer: All right. Well, thank you so much for chatting with me. It was great to learn about Los Angeles.

Ina: You're welcome.
