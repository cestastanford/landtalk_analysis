Daniel: Okay, I'm Daniel Kadji and this is...

Mr. Fleming: Mr. Fleming.

Daniel: Okay, where did you grow up at? 

Mr. Fleming: Omaha, Nebraska.

Daniel: Omaha, Nebraska. Did you...how long did you live there for?

Mr. Fleming: Twenty-eight years. 

Daniel: So when you first...when you were living up there, how was that area? How was, like, the environment when you first was growing up? 

Mr. Fleming: Very cold. The education system was A number one for the midwest. 

Daniel: It was, like, very good? 

Mr. Fleming: Very good. 

Daniel: Is there, like, a lot of trees or is it flatland?

Mr. Fleming: No. The midwest is flat, trust me. Flat for miles and miles the eye can see.

Daniel: Small towns, everybody knew everybody?

Mr. Fleming: Everybody knew everybody in the small town. Especially all the black people lived on one side of town, it was the north side. All the white people lived in the west side, and all the Hispanics and Native Americans lived on the south side. 

Daniel: They all go to the same school or the schools are all separated?

Mr. Fleming: When they became segregated in 1976, they had forced bussing. I mean that it was mandatory bussing, so that's when they started mixing, but before 1976 they were all separate schools. 

Daniel: That's cool. So as time evolved, how would you say the environment changed? 

Mr. Fleming: The environment changed with...I would say when they put the highway in it split the black community and the white community. So once the highway, you call it the beltway, once they created the beltway it went through the town, so that started creating a friction between north side, south side, and west side. 

Daniel: So before there wasn't a highway, the people would not drive cars?

Mr. Fleming: No, you just had to go through the city. But so once the highway came, it killed a lot of the businesses, you know, because the people who had to go through the city would go through the business side. They didn't have to go through the business, so that main money was being taken out of the community. 

Daniel: What kind of businesses were there? 

Mr. Fleming: Well you know, mainly your barber shops, your restaurants, movie theaters, each part of the town had their own movie theater, your repair shops, you know, suffered because the highway, people couldn't go through and didn't know that they exist. 

Daniel: So, like, on a typical day, Saturday, what would you have done for fun, like, back in the day? 

Mr. Fleming: Woah, yeah, back in the day we would go to the swimming pool. The swimming pool, went to the recreation center, the vocational, like, barber training, beautician training. We rode bicycles, you know, most people didn't have cars. You know, the young people didn't have cars. Older people had cars. You know, but the young people, no. We stayed in a neighborhood...I lived in the projects, so most years you probably didn't even leave out the projects because everything was around the project. But when the highway came...

Daniel: Everybody left. 

Mr. Fleming: Yeah, they destroyed all the projects in the city. 

Daniel: So later on, like, as time came on, would you, like, you said you would have done the same things? 

Mr. Fleming: It would have been difficult because most of the AAU came. AAU came and took a lot of players from out of the high school, and out of middle school. The recreation center always had, like, tournaments. But then when AAU came they took all the best players out the neighborhoods and put them in AAU teams, so the high schools and the middle schools suffered. 

Daniel: That sucks. Wouldn't you say that that would have helped the players because then they'll have more, like...

Mr. Fleming: Well when you have a neighborhood team, everyone knew everyone. Everyone knew how everyone played, whether it's football, baseball, softball, even table tennis. Once you take all the good players and no one knows anyone, it's, like, AAU is like an all-star team, you know? So when you have neighborhood teams you have neighborhood rivalries, you know, which was healthy. You know, you had one neighborhood against another neighborhood and whenever they met in tournaments they was at their best. So, and everyone played together for a long period of time. It developed the players, or even the ladies who played softball. Omaha is known as the softball capital of the world, people come all around the world to play in Omaha, Nebraska. They had the best softball fields, baseball fields, football fields, you know, so a lot of money was put in the community. But when that highway came through and AAU showed up, it just destroyed the neighborhood. 

Daniel: Can you think of any other ways that the highway affected, like, were there, like, animals, plants that changed? 

Mr. Fleming: The environment suffered immensely. Even today you have deer coming in the neighborhood because it's the only place they can find vegetation. Normally they would not. A lot of the bird species died, a lot of the...a lot of vacant homes because people couldn't find work in the neighborhood like they used to, so they had to go out west and they had to move where the jobs were at to be closer for a transportation concern. 

Daniel: Okay, thank you.
