Interviewer: Okay, so the first question is, what is the popular spot where everyone hung out? Like, what were some, like, places that everyone went to, like, while you were in high school and stuff?

Interviewee: The mall.

Interviewer: The mall, Prince Georges mall?

Interviewee: Prince Georges plaza mall.

Interviewer: How was it? Like, was it fun? Like, what were some of the things people were doing?

Interviewee: People were gathering at the food courts, mostly, at the urban shoe stores, like, where the latest footwear would come out, Foot Locker, DTLR. If not that, they'll probably hang out over their friend's house after school, stuff like that, but mostly at the mall.

Interviewer: Okay, so, what do you remember from the area? Like, were there any, like, old stores that were around?

Interviewee: Yes, there's one store that's no longer around, it's called Up Against the Wall. They sold a lot of urban clothing, the latest fashion. They were high priced, so, you had to have money to buy their stuff.

Interviewer: [inaudible 00:01:25]

Interviewee: Well, there is a lot of culture change. You can say that, that's coming around right now. Predominantly, there's a lot of stores that are high priced in other areas that you wouldn't think would be around here, but I think it's a good thing because I think that this area do need change.

Interviewer: Was the crime rate high? How's it changed over time?

Interviewee: It's really been consistent. This haven't really been a high crime area. So, I think it's been pretty consistent throughout the years. Nothing major ever happened in the area.

Interviewer: Okay, so what was the majority of the crime? Was it more like robbery, murder?

Interviewee: You will probably hear like of car theft. Robbery, no, murder, homicide, things like that, no, not at all.

Interviewer: What hobbies have you picked up over the years living here?

Interviewee: I would just say the normal teenage routine, go to the movies, shop at the mall, hang out at friends' houses. There would be a lot of after school activities such as it would keep a lot of dance, like Friday night dances at the schools. So, it was mostly still around my peers mostly.

Interviewer: Okay, do you enjoy, like, going to the movies, going to the mall now, now that you're older, just like back then?

Interviewee: Not as much, 'cause like I said, it would be after school. So, now when I go to the mall, it's, like, you are there when you need something, versus it just being a hangout spot.

Interviewer: Okay. What's the majority population or race? Like, is it Black, Hispanic?

Interviewee: Are you talking about now or back then?

Interviewer: Now compared to back then.

Interviewee: Right now I can still see it's still a lot of African Americans, a lot more Hispanics also, and a trickle of Caucasians now and then. So, the Caucasian, you just see a slight increase, not too much.

Interviewer: Okay, how do you feel about the slight change in population? Do you like, do you dislike it?

Interviewee: I think it's a good thing. Like, we can always use change. Change is always good, especially if it's for the better. If we're having more stores around the area, that means more job opportunities for other people.

Interviewer: Has there been any memorable big storms in the last 20 years? Any big thunderstorms, hurricanes, or maybe blizzards?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: No, okay. How do you feel about that? Do you think it's a good thing?

Interviewee: Not having major catastrophes in nature?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: That's a very good thing.

Interviewer: Yeah. Do you feel like Maryland is, like, one of the, like, best places to live because there's no known, like, big storms like hurricanes?

Interviewee: You can say that, yes.

Interviewer: Is there any issues within the community you would like to see resolved?

Interviewee: Not at the moment.

Interviewer: Not at the moment, all right. What do you like the most about the area today?

Interviewee: That it's quiet, and it's familiar, and it's been peaceful.

Interviewer: Okay. Has prices of living gone up over the years?

Interviewee: Yes, I used to rent a two-bedroom for 825 and now it's probably 1200. And, this was in 2008.

Interviewer: How do you feel about that?

Interviewee: I expected it. I mean, prices weren't the same back in 1998, so, I wouldn't expect it to stay the same. 1998 was probably 600. So, I expect things to go up.

Interviewer: Okay, last question. Have you ever seen any weird animals, or bugs, like, anything out the usual that you, like, never seen before?

Interviewee: I have not.

Interviewer: Have not. All right, would you be surprised if you did now, living here for so long?

Interviewee: Yes.

Interviewer: All right
