Interviewer: Okay. So the place that we are going to be talking about is Lanikai Beach. So my first question for you is how did Lanikai Beach look about 50 years ago and 20 years ago when you were there?

Interviewee: 50 years ago Lanikai Beach was about 30 feet wide at its narrowest point. And you could walk on it all the way from Kailua Beach to the end of Lanikai Beach.

Interviewer: So then how did that change up until 20 years ago?

Interviewee: 20 years ago the beach was narrowing considerably, but there was still room to walk on it. However, people were building sea walls to protect their properties from falling off into the ocean.

Interviewer: So how would you describe all those changes up until the present day?

Interviewee: Well, having just been out there the other day, I saw that the sea walls were not sufficient to hold the beach or the ocean and that people had been building double sea walls. And the ocean comes straight up to the sea wall and is about four feet deep where it hits the sea wall. So there is no beach there anymore.

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do on Lanikai Beach when it was still there?

Interviewee: Wow. We did everything on Lanikai Beach. We fished from the beach. We had epic football games on the beach. We played frisbee on the beach. We had bonfires on the beach. There was a lot of beach to sit on and we used every inch of it.

Interviewer: So what are some of the things that you could do there now, or would do there now?

Interviewee: Well, it's very limited. You would have to walk to one of the wider places of, which there are about six all along Lanikai Beach, and you would have to walk down the red way and shrink into the ocean just to swim. There's really nothing else you can do. And you can't go into the ocean from your ocean sub-property anymore because the walls are too steep and the ocean is too rough along it.

Interviewer: Wow. That's great. Thank you for answering my questions.

Interviewee: You're very welcome. Anytime.
