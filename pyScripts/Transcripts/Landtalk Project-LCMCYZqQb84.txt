When I first moved to 1808 Corner's [SP] Court, I lived in a cul-de-sac where there was nothing but trees to the left of my home. Four large wooded lots divided myself and the next neighbor. I lived at this property again for 20 years. 17 years ago it changed, because the developer, the builder, decided to tear down the trees and the lots were almost barren. All the tree lines were cut down. And again, most of the lots were barren. Also, he built a home next to me. So, we used to, prior to the home being built next to me, be able to enter the tree line, the trees, walk the dog, see neighbors. It was basically barren lots where we could just kind of stretch out, play on, do a number of things on just an open space. 

There used to be also a number of birds and wildlife, mainly deer that lived in those threes and inhabited there. We used to enjoy the open space quite a bit, especially the beauty of the trees in the fall and the spring. And again, we used to just be able to use those lots to play games, and up in front of them, prior to the tree line, sat through all kinds of activities and just enjoyed the beauty of the terrain and the environment. Now since there's a house next to us, and there's no trees, the wildlife and the deers have just about gone away. We miss that. 

We still are able to utilize some of the front, but it's not the same because tarps have been put there by the builder because of the trees, the missing trees, there's soil erosion that kind of comes down on the lot. So there's not a lot we can do on those properties that we used to do, especially now that we have a neighbor. I really miss the environmental terrain.
