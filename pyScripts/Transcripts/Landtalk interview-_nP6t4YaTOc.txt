Interviewer: Okay great. What is the name of the location?

Interviewee: South Salem in Salem, Oregon.

Interviewer: What did this place look like before, about 20 years ago?

Interviewee: Well, it was very green. Lots of just natural landscaping of pine trees, barns, a lot of wild blackberry bushes, some areas there are planted... people...somebody had planted vineyards so there were great vines, but most of it was just more natural vegetation and just a lot of deer would come through there. We would have deer come to our driveway and eat the flowers as soon as they started blooming, and also a lot of flowers in different seasons. You'd have flowering cherry blossoms spring, and then followed by a lot of rhododendrons and daffodils and tulips, the bulbs would all come up as aliens. And then getting more into the summer, then you'd have some of the fruit bushes would be blossoming, and then turning into fruit, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries.

Interviewer: Great. So how has this place changed since then?

Interviewee: There's been a lot of new housing development, and that has brought both more traffic and also just more people in the area. So there are still some of the wild blackberry bushes and things, but they are fewer than there used to be. And some of the places where I used to go pick berries, I just can't really find them much anymore. The bushes have been cut back or they've been completely removed to make room for new development, housing also, in some cases, it's retail development. And I also haven't seen as many deer, also not quite as many skunks, which is a good thing. But there used to be periodically a dead skunk, opossum, or something on the road, and I haven't seen those in a long time. There are still deer around, but not as much in South Salem, they sort of moved out farther outside the city where there's not as many houses.

There's still a lot of pine trees, those probably aren't affected too much. There's still a lot of vegetation in general, but just compared to what it was 20 years ago, there's just not as much of it. And also like I said, not as many animals around of just wildlife that would come and eat those kind of plants, eat the berries, especially.

Interviewer: So I think you mentioned that you like to pick berries. Is that one of the things you used to do back 20 years ago, and what were some of the other things you used to do?

Interviewee: Yes, I've always loved picking berries, again, and I used to do that a lot. And then I would make pies. And they were pretty easy to find and to pick. Unfortunately, the blackberries have stickers, but they were so abundant that you could find ones that you could pick without getting too many stickers and, you know. So I used to do that a lot. I still do it some but it's, like I said, a lot harder to find the berries. I also just really love going for walks and just enjoying the shade of the trees and the beautiful scenery. And I still do that, but I'm more likely to go to a park now to do that. There's a particular park that is reserved for the birds and the wildlife and there are a lot of people there, but it goes along the river and all. But it seems like some of the places where I used to walk where it was more, I would say, natural and not as many houses, there's just been a lot more development. And so there aren't as many of those kind of paths around where I can walk and not be in the middle of a neighborhood. You have to go further outside the city to do those kind of hikes or walks where you can just be out among the trees and the natural vegetation and not walking on a sidewalk in a housing development. 

Interviewer: Yeah. Is there anything else...you mentioned you still pick berries and still go on walks. Is there anything else that you do now in South Salem outside?

Interviewee: I take the dog to a dog park a lot, and I do like to garden. And we've had some years of a lot less rain and it's affected some of the lakes have not filled up. Actually, I used to go boating nearby. And the lake where we kept our boat actually didn't even open for boating one year, and then another year it was very, very minimal, they had to move the docks because there had been so little rain. So over the 20 years, there have been some years when we've had a lot more snowfall which then feeds the lake when it melts, and other years where there hasn't been as much. And I would say just lately it's been more on the dry side until this year. But that's throughout the 20 years that's sort of fluctuated. But I do like to go to places where there is water, to go to the river. Willamette River runs through Salem, or to go someplace where I can be on the water. And I guess that said, I do go to farms also to pick berries. There aren't as many, like I said, just wild ones in the neighborhood. So I'm more likely now to actually go to a place where berries have been planted and pick them there because I know I can find them.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you very much.

Interviewee: You're welcome.
