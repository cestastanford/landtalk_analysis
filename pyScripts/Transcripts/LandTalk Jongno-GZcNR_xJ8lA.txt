Interviewer: Okay. So hello, Dr. Kim. Thank you for agreeing to the interview today. So first of all, could you tell us a little bit about the place you're gonna talk about, like, have you ever lived there, what kind of place this is, where it is, and what's your connection to it?

Dr. Kim: I'd like to talk about Jongno which is one of the major thoroughfares in the downtown Seoul area and it is located between Gwanghwamun and Seoul City Hall. And I used to go there to buy books or to purchase some other items like musical instrument or some stationery because there are many shops there.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you. So could you talk a bit about the historic appearance of the place? So from your memory what it used to look like, what was the atmosphere in Jongno.

Dr. Kim: In the '70s actually it was one of the most crowded streets in downtown Seoul area. And because it was before the southern part of the Han River was developed, and so, there were a lot of shops including one of the major bookstores, Jongno Bookstore and a lot of bakeries there like Taegeuk Bakery and other Korea bakery and so on and some other shops like, you know, coffee shops and some other shops. And what's interesting in the '70s was that there were different segments or sections on the street in Jongno and also some of the parallel streets like Euljiro and Junggye-ro [SP] because there was some book shop area, and also there was some electricity area like they sell a lot of electricity related materials. And there were also some areas where they sell a lot of musical instruments near Nakwon, it's a Jongno 3-ga or Jogno 4-ga. So near there. So there were also a lot of places where they sell old books and foreign magazines, and so on. So there were a lot of shops there.

Interviewer: Yeah. So it sounds like it was a very busy, very popular shopping area. So...

Dr. Kim: That's right. Very popular and buses, and taxis, and major public transportation usually brought us to there.

Interviewer: So a major transportation hub as well. So from your experience how do you think Jongno and its sort of function or appearance changed over time? So in the modern day, does it still hold up as a major population center or what do you think the changes were in the modern day?

Dr. Kim: What disappeared is usually… I mean, these small shops. There were a lot of small shops, you know, stationery shops and grocery shops, and these bakeries I talked about. And instead, those small shops have now been replaced by franchise stores and some big shops because there is the... For example, I mean, in Jongno 3-ga, there is this shoe store, Kumgang. Kumgang is a very famous shoe maker in Korea and there is this shoemaking shop there. But, I mean, that is now competing with many other foreign brand shops there in Jongno 3-ga and other places as well. You know, a lot of Starbucks and other franchise, sometimes foreign, sometimes domestic coffee shops and big bakeries now replaced some of the small local bakeries and local shops there. So I think now, there are more shops, but more commercialized and not very local. But in some of the places, you usually see in other districts of downtown Seoul.

Interviewer: So it sounds like a lot of the local shops are now replaced with larger chains, more…larger franchises.

Dr. Kim: That's right, that's right.

Interviewer: Okay. So you kind of did mention this. So I'd like to ask you about sort of the activities that you used to do in Jongno compared to what you do now. So you mentioned that you did a lot of shopping, you went to buy your books, your musical instruments, and such in Jongno. Are there any other sort of activities that you like to do historically back in the day?

Dr. Kim: In the '70s when I was...I think when I was a teen and also I went to middle school at the time, so I went there to purchase books, sometimes old, sometimes new. And I also went there to purchase musical instrument, for example, guitar, for example, and also some other stuff. And we also went there to meet people. I mean, the Jongno Bookstore was such a kind of, you know, conspicuous locality there. So we usually make kind of…you know, have an arrangement to meet there. It's a meeting place or a meeting point for a lot of people. So also, there was some meeting places like a lot of coffee shops and local coffee shops I talked about. So we usually meet there one-on-one or, you know, many to many, and so on. So there were meeting places there.

These days I go there, but usually to meet people and so on. But, I mean, the major difference is that this space we are using, I mean, these franchise, some kind of international kind of stores rather than local stores or small shops. So basically, I'm doing the same thing maybe, but these days, I don't go there too often to purchase things because there are many other, you know, good stores not only in the downtown, but also in the suburbs and so on. So I usually go there to meet people who are working at the Central Seoul District because there are a lot of companies and a lot of big corporations near that area.

Interviewer: I see. So, yeah. So I think for a lot of younger Koreans these days including myself, the things that you described like where you go shopping or where you go to meet people, I think a lot of my generation, people would first think of the Gangnam District. So you mentioned how one of the more newer developed regions would be below the Han River with the Gangnam District as we call it. So how do you think... So these days, do you think that the position that Jongno or like the northern region holds compared to the southern region, do you think it's different or do you think it's maybe the southern region being developed has taken some of the position that the northern region used to hold or what do you think the sort of contrast between the two regions might be?

Dr. Kim: Definitely. I think, I mean, the status of Jongno area, it was really the central meeting place in the '70s and the '80s. But now, it gave away, I mean, this status, this dominant status to Gangnam area. So when you think of... When younger generation, I think, they think of, you know, a place to meet, they definitely think of, you know, Gangnam area near Gangnam Station and so on. But do not think that much about Jongno area. So Jongno area, you know, sadly... For example, Jongno 3-ga is very famous as a meeting place for older people in their 60s, not even in the 60s, but the 70s and 80s, you know, grandpas and grandmas usually meet there. So, but for my generation, we usually, I mean, we instantaneously thought of Jongno area when we're arranging a meeting or when we purchase. So that was really kind of magnet kind of place for our activities whether it's shopping, whether it's meeting, or whether it's arranging some other activities there. So now, I think it really gave away the status of being the center of Seoul to Gangnam area. So I think there has been a lot of change there.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you very much for your answers. This has been very helpful. Thank you once again for responding to the interview and thank you very much.

Dr. Kim: My pleasure.
