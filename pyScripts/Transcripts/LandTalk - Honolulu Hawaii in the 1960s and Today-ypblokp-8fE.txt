Interviewer: So when did you first move to Honolulu?

Interviewee: The city proper? We're talking Honolulu, the city proper?

Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

Interviewee: That was in the '60s, [inaudible 00:00:11] I guess.

Interviewer: Can you describe the area from that time?

Interviewee: In the '60s?

Interviewer: Mm-hmm. When you first moved there.

Interviewee: It's a small, actually small city, compared to other urban area city. In the United States, it's a small urban financial and, you know, business area in the city of Honolulu. I lived in rental units here and there. And then after that I moved to Hawaii Kai. But what was it like, the city? Honolulu was, it is never sleepy town, but it was fairly active, you know, as far as people and business. But it wasn't a metropolis, by any stretch of the imagination. But early '60s, you had, not skyscrapers, but you had tall buildings. I'd say maybe 15, 20 starter buildings scattered here and there. Now you have them pretty much cluttered. And you have of course, [inaudible 00:01:32] buildings in a 30 [inaudible 00:01:34], 35 square area, sizes. So you have bigger, taller building, and much more cluttered. 

And adjacent to the city proper, the metropolis proper, you have the harbor. And the harbor area, of course, is right now. From the olden days you had, of course, you have piers that built on [inaudible 00:02:09]. Ships used to come in, mostly for transporting goods. And nowadays you have a lot more ships that have passengers to actually for the, you know, pleasure cruises that come into the harbor. So that's a big change. We never did see so many ships, big ships, thousand foot ships that used to come in the harbor. Now you have regular dockings of pleasure ships that come in. So that's a significant change that you see in the harbor area.

As far as, that's about the major thing that I can think about as far as from the olden days. One day we were, you know, smaller [inaudible 00:03:04]. No reason for pleasure ships coming into the harbor. And of course, the tourist industry, of course, accordingly has grown from you know, let's see, I can't recall what stats right now is. But, it's quite a bit of change. From let's say a million or two annual visitors to now about 30, 34, as far as Honolulu.

Interviewer: Would you say there are any changes in like the infrastructure?

Interviewee: The streets of course, as far as, they're not that much different, but pretty much the same. But you have freeways that can be into the city, that weren't there before. You have three freeways that give you access to the city proper. That's of course, that's a major change. But other than that, not much of a change there.

Interviewer: Would you say like the tourism has significantly changed the, I guess, natural landscape of Honolulu?

Interviewee: Tourists?

Interviewer: Yeah. You mentioned tourism as a major change. How do you think tourism has impacted the natural landscape?

Interviewee: Of course, you have tourists, you have to have housing. So you have high rises, hotels that are high rises in the Waikiki area that have sprung up since the boom of tourism. So, you have more multistory hotels in the Waikiki area. But along with that, you need to have sporting things and pleasure things and recreational things. So the increase in those areas are actually [inaudible 00:05:34] the kind of businesses that have, like you know, like catamarans, that do night sails, that do dinner sails, that kind of stuff. You know, all the innovations that they put in to attract the tourism and keep the market bright. I could have done deep fishing business that cater to the tourists. Affects living quarters and the expansion of high rise buildings, and the entertainment, or what the people, the tourists would come to see. And then, changes. 

Oh yeah, okay, one major, major change, that [inaudible 00:06:28] disappeared. In not the city proper, but just the outskirts of it, you know, a couple of hours out, there was this Honolulu Stadium, where we used to have all sports activities. You name it, they used to have all the sports activities over there. But that was replaced by the Aloha Stadium. And this is in the Oahu area. So it's further out. It's outside of the area. You know, [inaudible 00:07:02]. The old stadium is there now, so that's where all the major sports activities are held today. Today, the thing is a park. They leveled it and made it a park. So that's one major difference. What else...?

Interviewer: So basically there have been additions, many urban additions, that facilitate tourism and cultural relations, and sports and other recreational activities and markets. What are some of the activities you would pursue in the past in Honolulu, versus some activities you would pursue now?

Interviewee: In Honolulu? In the younger days, bowling was a thing, the activity that was the most popular. Now bowling has almost died down. You have bowling alleys here and there, but nobody talks about bowling nowadays, not much anyway. And not too many people participate in that. And after bowling died down, then golf came on. So that's why, turned from bowling to golf. Now golf is of course popular. And they're expensive of course, golf courses. The demise of bowling alleys and the rise of a lot of golf courses. Again, of course, that's linked to tourists too. 

So, I used to dive a lot, you know, skin diving. I used to dive, because I used to live next to the ocean. So, a dive in the ocean for me was, you know, totally out of skin diving when I came into town. So, skin diving you don't use any lung. You don't use any oxygen tanks. Just there, just with a mask.

Interviewer: Okay. So you would go skin diving the beaches?

Interviewee: Yeah. And then, in [inaudible 00:09:28] is super skin diving [inaudible 00:09:30]. I used to make my pin money in skin diving. We used to catch fish there and tako, octopus.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you very much.

Interviewee: Okay.
