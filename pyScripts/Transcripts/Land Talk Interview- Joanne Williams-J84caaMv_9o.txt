Interviewer: Can you introduce yourself?

Joanne Williams: My name is Joanne Williams, better known as "Mummum" to my grandchildren (laughs).

Interviewer: What are you going to talk about today?

JW: I'm going to talk about the Appalachian Mountains in and around Boone, North Carolina.

Interviewer: How long did you live in Boone?

JW: Well, I'm going to talk about it over a 40 year period. I actually lived in Boone for 33 years but in the last 8 years I still know about it. So I'm going to talk about some things from the last 8 years.

Interviewer: What did the place used to look like?

JW: I have several little stories to tell you so we'll take them one by one, okay?

Interviewer: OK, what is your first story?

JW: OK, my first story is about the Price Lake Trail. Price Lake has a trail around the lake that's 2 miles long. There was kind of a waterway, a creek, that ran through it. And many years ago it was just a little creek that ran near the trail and then over the years the water kind of spread out. So instead of being a little creek it was kind of a big swamp. And so the Park Service had to build a long boardwalk so people could still walk around that trail and not get their feet wet in the swamp.

Interviewer: Cool. What is your second short story?

JW: My second one is about Bass Lake. And Bass Lake is a very popular trail. People like to walk around this lovely lake. It is about one mile. And in all the years that I have been walking around that lake it's stayed pretty much the same. When I went back just this last September and walked there the lake was very much the same, it looked to be the same size and shape. And part of that is done because the Park Service has a mechanism whereby they can let more water out of the lake or keep more water in the lake depending on the conditions. So sometimes they let more water run down the creek to the side of it, and sometimes they keep the water in the lake.

There are also a lot of lily pads that grow sometimes and the Park Service trims those out and so the lake has about the same amount of lily pads as it used to. There are also big maple trees that grow around the sides of the lake and when one of those trees falls down, the Park Service has planted another tree that starts to grow. There is a lot of effort to keeping that lake the same as it used to be.

Interviewer: What is your third short story?

JW: Well, the third is a little longer story. There is a tributary of the New River, it's a river whose actual name is called the New River and it has - sort of like the Willamette River has different rivers that feed into it. It has a fork of the river that ran sort of close to where we used to live - where your mother grew up, in her house. Many years ago a Lowe's hardware store came and built a big store kind of close to the river and they made a big parking lot you know like you see at Lowe's hardware stores or big hardware stores.

So, the water couldn't soak into the ground like it used to. And after that big huge store with a big huge parking lot was built - and it was all concrete - the water didn't have any place to go, it started flooding our neighborhood. The water ran over the banks of the fork of the river there, and then after a while it would run up into the streets. And one time, there was so much water - a hurricane was happening - there was so much water that our whole neighborhood flooded. Some people had to ride out in boats out of the neighborhood. We didn't, we stayed in our attic. Anyway, the whole neighborhood looked like a lake instead of a neighborhood.

We were the second to the last family that they were going to take out in the boat and we watched our neighbors - we watched out the attic window - we watched our neighbors get soaked in the rain and walk out to the boat and everything. The water was starting to recede by that time so we said "no thank you". (laughs) We just got down and tore the carpet out of my house and went to the store and got a big heater and dried out the subflooring - that's what is under your floor, called subflooring - and dried it out and got a new pretty green carpet and put it right back in.

The town applied to the Federal Emergency Management to buy our houses and move the houses from where they were - where we lived in them - to a another place. So they had to pay to move - they took all these houses on big trucks and moved them to someplace else in town. They paid us for those houses so that we could go live someplace else, all the people in that neighborhood.

Now, that land is.. they made a law that nobody can live overnight in that area anymore, but people can go there during the day. So they have some ball fields and some park area and they made a big walking trail along the river and through there. So a lot of people use it for recreation now and lots of people walk that walking trail that was built close to and through the area where we used to live.

Interviewer: How did Boone change in the past 40 years?

JW: How did Boone change... and the Appalachian ... how the the land change around Boone change in the last 40 years? In some places it stayed very much the same. I would say in the mountain regions around the town have stayed very much the same, sometimes with the help of humans. I think in general I think some other places in the town have more flooding than there used to be, in addition to our neighborhood. So I think that the the town has more flooding.

Interviewer: Cool. What activities did you used to do?

JW: I liked to go hiking.

Interviewer: Did you do any other activities?

JW: (laughs) My main thing as it relates to the land was hiking, however I liked to do a lot of gardening and I had gardens in various places over those years. It was a pretty good place to grow a garden there. It had a pretty good growing season from about May until October and pretty good soil there. Lots of people like to grow gardens there, it's a good place for farming and gardening.

Interviewer: Thank you for being my interviewee.

JW: Well, thank you for interviewing me. It was a pleasure.
