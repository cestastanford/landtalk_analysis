Edward: Hello. My name is Edward Delane. I have lived in Natick Massachusetts since 1997.

Interviewer: So I'm gonna ask my dad a couple of questions about our house, which is located on Jennings Pond right on the shore. So can you describe how the pond used to look when you first moved there about 20 years ago?

Edward: Well, when we first moved in, our narrow end of the pond was clogged with silt and water plants. And it looked more like a stream running through a marsh whereas the other end of the pond was open water. And then 18 years ago, the town, in an effort to restore the pond to its previous state, dredged our shallow end of the pond and opened it up again. So we had open water reflecting the sky. And it attracted flocks of waterbirds. 

Interviewer: And how has the pond changed since the dredging event?

Edward: Well, that was the most dramatic change I've seen in the pond. But in the 18 years since then, there's been some more subtle changes. We've seen some changes in the animals. I remember a time when there were more eastern painted water turtles than there are now. I haven't seen one in a long time actually, but used to see them often. And while we still have a resident pair of swans, the larger flocks of waterbirds like Canada geese seem to have chosen to move on to other ponds. We don't have them on ours anymore.

We used to have a fairly uniform bank of a low-lying ivy of sorts on the hillside headed down to the pond. And for reasons I don't understand, that's really kind of faded away into a small patch. And most of the hillside now is prone to sprout up other kinds of things including poison ivy in the warmer weather.

I think it's true that our weather has been a little more extreme in recent years. Two years ago, I already had nine and a half feet of snow, which was the most snow on record for any year in this area. And in just the last few weeks, we had two snow storms in late March and early April, with winter seeming to go into spring more than it usually does. One of those last two storms actually was fierce enough to border on being a blizzard and tore some siding off the house.

Interviewer: Okay. And then the last questions I have are just, what are some things that you used to do in the yard or at the pond? And can you compare those things to things that you do now?

Edward: Well, that's a tricky question. Let me think. So I didn't pay much attention to the back yard until they dredged the pond. There wasn't that much attraction for me although, of course, the marsh-like environment was probably rich with the little animals and so forth. But after they dredged it, I started working in the back yard. I spent more than a year building stairs to reach down to the pond. And then for a while, I used the stairs to put a kayak into the pond and paddle around on the pond. I paused doing that, but I hope to get back to doing that.
