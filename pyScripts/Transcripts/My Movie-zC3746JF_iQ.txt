Machine: ...call is now being recorded.

Interviewer: Hello, can you give me a brief introduction of yourself, please?

Cyrus: Well, sure. My name's Cyrus Jennings. 64 years old. I've lived here most of my life.

Interviewer: Lived where most of your life?

Cyrus: Right here at Arroyo Grande.

Interviewer: Okay, Arroyo Grande, California. 

Cyrus: That's right.

Interviewer: That is at 35 degrees north, 120 degrees west on the central coast of California. 

Cyrus: Well, I ain't no map maker, but that sounds right to me. But yeah, it's on the central coast, yeah.

Interviewer: Okay, so you've lived here on the central coast for most of your life. What did this place look like 20 years ago, and how has it changed?

Cyrus: 20 years ago, back in 1996 there was a lot more [inaudible 00:01:06] people's grass in 1996. Big 76 gas station ball was still up. There was a big old tree by the old animal hospital. That tree and that hospital, they're gone now. Well, the hospital, they moved actually, they're just a block away, right across from the first McDonald's on Grand Avenue. That McDonald's has changed a lot since 1996. Looks like an H&R Block now. 

Interviewer: Okay, so things have moved around a little bit since 20 years ago. How would you say the natural landscape has changed? Is there more or less vegetation and things like that, like forests?

Cyrus: Oh sure, they cut some trees down. Arroyo Grande in 1996 was a different place and time altogether. This was before the Efron boy was in all the big pictures. Efron lived in Arroyo Grande, you know. There's about the same amount of white as there is now, maybe more. There's more black now than then, but... There was more Asian back then than there is now. They still use a lot of Hispanics for the crops. But one thing I would say is different now than it was is, was back then, is these Hispanic workers smile more. I don't know if that means things have gotten better over here, or if things are just kinda worse where they came from.

Interviewer: Okay, okay. Yeah, so that's the way that it's changed. What were some of the activities that you used to do in Arroyo Grande back 20 years ago? Did you do a lot of hiking, or...?

Cyrus: Oh, there's plenty of hiking to do. I used to take the kids to Klondikes Pizza every other Saturday. They got new owners now, shitty ones. They don't make the cheeseburger pizza anymore. I used to walk down and see a show at the old Fair Oaks Theater with my darling Mary Sue. But my wife found out about Mary Sue in 2004, so I don't see pictures at the Fair Oaks anymore. I don't hardly see Mary Sue, either. 

Interviewer: Okay, okay. So what are some of the things that you do now in Arroyo Grande?

Cyrus: Well, now I don't get outta the house much these days, osteoporosis keeps me indoors mostly. I got poor arthritic knees and I can barely see shit outta my good eye. The bad eye sees too much, especially when that Pierce Morgan comes on the tele. I tell you what I would do if I could walk, I'd take a stroll through the village, walk that old swinging bridge over the creek. Maybe bring some corn and feed the roosters.

Interviewer: Okay, and how has the creek changed over the years?

Cyrus: You used to be able to take a canoe ride down that thing. Now it's pretty much all dried up.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. Yeah, the lack of rain, the drought has kind of affected the local environment, I see.

Cyrus: That's right, it's a lot lower.

Interviewer: What about the beach? Arroyo Grande's near the beach. How has your view of the beach changed across the past 20 years?

Cyrus: They have marine layers but they're thick on days, I'd say. It's a bit more fog, a bit more pollution in the sky. You know, the beach has just got more trash on in it in general these days. But 20 years ago it was a lot cleaner. I used to take my boat out, be able to do a drag for clams and oysters and whatnot. You can't do that anymore, you get in trouble.

Interviewer: Okay, okay. Well, thank you very much for this interview. I appreciate it, Mr. Jennings.

Cyrus: Thank you, son. Thank you for reaching out to me.

Interviewer: Oh, of course. Okay. Well, take care. Bye-bye.

Cyrus: [inaudible 00:05:50]
