Interviewer: All right. Could you say your name, please? 

Ruth: My name is Ruth Saunders. 

Interviewer: What's the place you're going to be talking about?

Ruth: I'm going to be talking about Headington, Oxford, where I grew up and where I've spent a lot of time since then, and visit frequently.

Interviewer: Cool. How did the police look when you were growing up? 

Ruth: When I grew up, this area, which is a suburb of Oxford, probably four miles, three miles from the city center, was maybe a quarter of a mile from open countryside set with suburban but it was surrounded by a ring of greenland, open fields. Quarter of a mile away from our house, less than a quarter mile, there was a playground, and beyond that there was a stream and fields. There was nothing as far as that, that I could see.

Interviewer: Great. What does it look like now? 

Ruth: Now, all of that area, the stream, and the fields, have been developed by a hospital. It's the John Radcliffe Hospital, it's one of the largest teaching hospitals in the UK. And as a result of that development and the need for accommodation, all the space between there and the ring road, maybe two, three miles further out, is now a pretty much built on. What was open space is now no longer open space. 

Interviewer: What are some of the things that you used to do here when you were a kid? 

Ruth: When I was a little kid there, it was possible to go down and catch frogs and tadpoles in the stream and we did that. And it was possible to trespass into the fields and just basically see nothing except field. I was quite scared of that. I mean, I was really quite scared climbing over the field, getting into the stream because beyond that there was absolutely nothing except that as far as you could see. And that freedom to do that has completely gone because the entire area is built up and built over now. I think I also talked about might also talk to you about the shops and the businesses that have grown up in the area since that time if that will be helpful. 

Interviewer: Yeah, definitely.

Ruth: So when I was growing up there, there were small isolated little shops. There would be, you know, a greengrocer and a fish and chips shop and a news agent and a butchers. This is probably typical of any English suburb, almost like a little village. But if you imagine a gigantic hospital coming in and all the professionals that come and live there, then consequently you now have a lot of realtors there because you have a huge demand for housing in the area. You have a lot of restaurants and you have big grocery stores, big supermarkets of the kind that you didn't need when it was a relatively small suburb. And then additionally, Oxford Brookes University, which when I was growing up was maybe a thousand students max all commuting, has become a large residential university with probably 5,000 students all residentially living in the area. So it's become a sort of thriving town of its own with all the services that a student community requires as well. So the character of it has entirely changed. But the open space part has vanished.

Interviewer: Okay. So briefly, although you sort of touched on this. What are some of the things you do in Headington nowadays?

Ruth: We go out for dinner. You can go and eat really well, which was absolutely impossible when I was growing up there. There was nowhere to go out and eat. There was a fish and chips shop, like take-out fish and chips. That was it. There was nowhere even to get a cup of coffee. So that would be the main thing that you would do that would be different. There's also an extraordinary good college bookstore, which again there wasn't. And you can go and look at property and browse property in a way that nobody would have done there when I was growing up, when property turnover was quite low. It was a kind of secluded, quiet, slightly grand residential area. You were there because it was quiet. You were not there because it was thriving. 

Interviewer: Great. That should be good. Thank you.

Ruth: Okay. You're welcome.
