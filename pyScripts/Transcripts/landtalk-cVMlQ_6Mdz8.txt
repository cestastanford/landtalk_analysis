Interviewer: Hello everyone. I'm here with my father, Christian Okwara, and we're going to be talking about the creek that was adjacent to our house. It's called Mill Creek and it is in Lower Bucks County in Pennsylvania. Dad, how would you say the creek has changed since you first moved in?

Christian: The creek has changed from both the water level and the pollution level. When we moved in it was fresh and I took my kids out to the creek. We looked for fish, we play, we sat around the space for playing games, football. Other kids come and play. People walked their pets along. It was more like a meeting place for the whole residential area. It was more like a social place. But as time goes on the population changes and the more pollution, the water gets to the point that we don't even see fish anymore in the creek.

Interviewer: Would you also say that the water level changed significantly from when you first moved in to now?

Christian: Yes, the water level changes...Again, before it used to be very pure that you will tend to want to drink it, even though the country doesn't want you to drink from it. But now the color has changed to brownish and this is as a result of the population changes. Because when we move in it is mostly elderly [inaudible 00:01:48], and as people moved in, younger folks move in with their kids and pollution level goes up and people start dumping garbages and trash and the creek changed and also the water levels decreases, very low because it doesn't flow freely like it used to flow.

Interviewer: Okay. What are some things that you used to do back then?

Christian: Well, like I said earlier, I liked to take you guys...that is one of the reasons why I bought the house close to the creek. Because I liked to go to the creek area, walk along the creek with my children and we looked at the fish and sometimes you guys want to wet your feet or jump in and wet your feet, especially during the summer. It is a recreational area, but I think as soon as that disappeared, that's one of the reasons why I decided to move out of the area.

Interviewer: Before you moved, how would you say your activity changed by the creek, so like before you used to want to go to that area, dip your feet in? How would you say your activity in that area changed?

Christian: It changes because number one, the water level changes, the water color changes. The water is a bit polluted, garbages is being dumped there so I don't think it is safe to take you people there. And as soon as I felt that the creek is being polluted and the township is not doing much to either stop the pollution or correct it, I decided to move.

Interviewer: Okay. I think those are all the questions that I have for you, so thank you very much for being interviewed.

Christian: Thank you, my daughter. Good job. Bye.
