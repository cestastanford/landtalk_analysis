Interviewer: So today for the land talk project I will be interviewing my mom about the Alamo Heights United Methodist Church in San Antonio, Texas, who she's been visiting for more than 20 years now. Mom, how would you describe the way this place used to look?

Interviewee: Well, it's always been very beautiful, but it has gotten larger over the years. They've added a small chapel. They've added a large atrium where people gather between services and they eat and drink together. Also, another thing they've added on is the columbarium, which is a peaceful place where people are interred. Is that how you say that?  

Interviewer: Ashes, yeah.

Interviewee: Ashes are interred and that would be as far as physical that's the biggest difference that I've seen at the church in the last 20 years. As far as people, the church is growing and people are getting older, but they have a very large children's group where I spent many years working at and taking my children to.

And what else did you wanna know?

Interviewer: Okay, so you covered the entire question of how the place has changed. Just like aesthetically how would you say the place used to look, you know, was it large and white or, you know, how did it look when you first started going, just physically?

Interviewee: It's always been large. It is white outside. Most of what I remember is the red carpet and the sanctuary and the red kneelers. And then at the altar, when they first started the church someone embroidered kneeling cushions and they're green with gold. 

Interviewer: Okay. Very cool. And so, like you said, you've been going to the church for a while. What are some of the things that you used to do that you haven't really done as much in the past say five or so years? What are some things that you did at the beginning of your time at the church?

Interviewee: Well, we were members of a Sunday school class that met in the children's wing upstairs, there are two wings to the church. So we did that for many years. I also attended a women Bible study every Monday morning. And my children, at the time, when I was there, would be in childcare downstairs. I also had my AMASS [SP] meetings there with my women friends every Tuesday evening, so I did that. We also spent many times...every year we would take our children to the pumpkin patch and let them run around, and we'd pick pumpkins. Also used to have a harvest festival that we would get us a family. Also, of course, Sunday school for my children. I helped with Sunday school and VBS was every year, Vacation Bible School, we'd do that every summer.

Interviewer: And then...

Interviewee: That's what I used to do.

Interviewer: ...the nativity scene as well at play.

Interviewee: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. We did nativity the live nativity scene where my children would be shepherds and my husband I would be King Herod and his dancing group. So it was a family experience we would do that every year as well.

Interviewer: Great. And now that your kids have grown up and you're doing more so just with your husband, what are some things you do here now, I guess the younger sister as well?

Interviewee: Well, we attend service, early service, and we are still members of our Sunday school class. Our daughter is in the youth group, the senior high, so we take her to Sunday school as well. And then she also has Bible study during the week that we have taken her to before. Also, she has a movie night at church that we take her to. I have been...in the last year I was in a Bible study, another women's bible study, upstairs in the church. I did that for several months. What else? What else do we do?

I help with the Hope Center by donating food, so I take that up there. 

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: That's about it right now.

Interviewer: It sounds...
