Joshua: Hi. This is Joshua Orrick and I'm doing my interview for the "Land Talks Assignment in Ecology for Everybody" at Stanford University. The location I chose is Newport Pier in Orange County, California. And I will be interviewing my mother, Juliana Orrick. So, Juliana, how do you describe the way that Newport Pier used to look 20, 30 years ago?

Juliana: Well, it looks pretty much the same from back then as it does now. The struct center around it had changed, of course. And the kinds of cars that park in the parking lot. But the pier itself is pretty much the same.

Joshua: Has there been any renovations maybe? Upgrades, to make it more safe?

Juliana: Not that I know of and not that I recognize, either. It looks pretty much the same as it did way back then. People fishing off of it and everything else. It looks the same to me.

Joshua: Got it. So, what are some of the things that you used to do at Newport Pier 20, 30 years ago?

Juliana: Mostly, just walk on it especially at night. I loved being there at night and just looking off over the rail at the ocean and we'd often go underneath the pier during the day just to get shade. Just the beach was always a frequent spot for me and the people I was with, so. The pier is just a great meeting spot.

Joshua: Got it. And what are some of the things that you do at the Newport Pier now?

Juliana: Just the same thing. We I go to the pier at night just to see who's out there, just to watch the ocean. And we were just down there last weekend and hung out underneath the pier with a group of people. We take pictures under there. We just do everything that you normally do at the beach, but that's just a meeting spot and kind of where we hang out by.

Joshua: Cool. And it's good to hear that the place hasn't change much over the years. And...

Juliana: Right.

Joshua: What about changes to maybe the wildlife or creatures you'd see there?

Juliana: Well, you hear of things like the red tide and how that might affect the area. And I'm sure that's something that goes along with ecology in terms of what we've been doing in the water and how that affects it. Regarding some of the other wildlife, I'm not sure how much that it would be different right now. I'm not aware of that or anything, right?
 
Joshua: Got it. Well, thank you so much for talking to me.

Juliana: Okay.

Joshua: Bye.
