Interviewer: Okay, so the name of the location that you want to talk about.

Interviewee: So I'd like to talk about the area east of the UCSD campus. That's now known as the Golden Triangle.

Interviewer: Okay. I said, I need latitude and longitude. I can find that later. So the Golden Triangle.

Interviewee: La Jolla, California.

Interviewer: Okay. So how did this place look before? I see you went to college at UCSD at grad school, right?

Interviewee: I did.

Interviewer: How did this place look before?

Interviewee: I went to graduate school at UCSD and I lived in what was called the Mesa apartments. And at that time, that was where development ended. The only other thing out there was a shopping center called the university town center. And that was probably, maybe like a half a mile away. And the rest of the area out there was all untouched, a native coastal Sage scrub habitat. It was all open space filled with native species at that time. And that was between 1982 and 1989.

Interviewer: Okay. And how has it changed? If you wanna talk about the kind of progression over time as you've lived in San Diego since then, or kind of like a stark contrast then and now. However, you want to talk about that.

Interviewee: So, you know, it was pretty interesting. Back then, I had a friend who was a graduate student, she was actually doing her research out there. She was studying the native California mouse. And we would go out and we were trapping for mice out there. So we spent a lot of time out in that habitat. And I know that firsthand, that there were a lot of native species living out there. And she was studying, you know, the genetic differences that were occurring because those populations were cut off from the populations that were on the coast by a lot of the development that was happening. So the development was progressing over time.

Actually, during the time that she was working out there, some of the development...the plants were in place, and some of the development was beginning to go in. And by the end of the time in my graduate school, those open space areas were getting smaller. But if you were to go out there today, you would basically see not one bit of native habitat. It is completely filled in by mostly shopping, retail, banking, multi-use, some medical offices, some housing. Every inch of space between the campus and university, the city, the town center, the mall and beyond there now...and the mall is actually expanding, is now completely developed. And there isn't any data of open space left in that area at all anymore.

Interviewer: And there hasn't been any effort to kind of maintain that or maintain biodiversity, or are there places nearby where those native species still exist, or is it all completely...?

Interviewee: So that particular area is all completely developed. There was an effort in San Diego County called the Multi-Species Conservation Plan, or the MSCP, where it was decided as a region, that we wanted to maintain some open space. So there were some areas that were designated as open space, basically, those were set aside. And in return, other areas were allowed to be developed. So there is still open space in San Diego County within the MSCP. But because the MSCP was set aside, it kind of basically paved the way so to speak for other areas of open space to go ahead and be developed.

And it's been a little bit controversial. A lot of people felt like the MSCP was a good idea, but nobody really knew if enough space was set aside, and if the spaces that were set aside were connected enough to preserve...you know, to allow the different species to be able to persist. And a lot of money was put into buying the habitat to set aside the preserve, but not a lot of money was set aside to manage the preserve over time. So there hasn't really been a lot of follow up to see how well the preserve system is working. And that's been one of the criticisms of the MSCP.

Interviewer: Okay. Okay, so I know you mentioned that used to go do fieldwork with one of your friends. What are some of the other things that used to do in this area?

Interviewee: Well, you know, it was just a nice place to take a walk. It was adjacent to where we lived and it was flat, which also made it really attractive to developers. That's one of the other things that happened in San Diego County is that, a lot of the flat areas got developed and a lot of the canyon areas didn't because they weren't so good for development, right? The hilly areas are the ones that you see...that are still undeveloped and you see a lot of development on the flat mesotops. But it was just a great place to just go walk basically, and relax and get out into nature, de-stress a little bit from school I guess.

Interviewer: Yeah, very understandable. Have you been back there recently? Or what are the some of the things that you do there now, if you go back frequently?

Interviewee: I mean, you've actually been there when we would drive over to La Jolla country day, for you to go to your baseball practice. We're actually driving right through that area. And the street that we would drive down, Genesee there, on both sides of the street, that area, the East Gate mall area, that is the area that used to be open space.

Interviewer: So, yeah. So well, I'm thinking back about it and it's completely developed. There's nothing there except for buildings, shopping malls, food places, all that.

Interviewee: Yes, exactly. So it's changed a lot in what I would consider to be a relatively...in the grand scheme of things a relatively short amount time.

Interviewer: Right. I don't know, if you have any other concluding thoughts on it and a sum up of how you feel about the change or what you think should be done or could be done to go back to that original kind of native habitat, if there, you have any thoughts about that.

Interviewee: Well, just that, I think that, you know, the native habitat in San Diego County, people tend to overlook it a little bit because it doesn't have the big flashy species. But we have a lot of really interesting and important native species. And if there were anything that, you know, I think would be good would be if there was more public awareness about those species and appreciation for them.

And if people that we do live on the edges of Canyon, where those species still exist, knew a little bit more about them, did things like...simple things like, you know, keeping their cats indoors, you know, putting out bird feeders, putting out, planting out native plants in their yards, butterfly-friendly plants. There's a lot of things that people can do that can help native species that I think they're just not aware of. So, you know, that is something that, you know, through my work at the San Diego Zoo, we do try to promote. But you know, it's difficult because everybody wants to live in San Diego. It's a great place to live. You know that, you grew up here. I mean, we live here. And so development, you know, is occurring...

Interviewer: It's inevitable, sometimes.

Interviewee: It's inevitable, I think. I just hope it can be done in the best possible way so that it can accommodate, you know, some of these species continuing to exist. And I hope that...you know, I have a lot of hope that the multiple species conservation program that those lands can be managed into the future and continue to preserve those species. It makes me sad when I go to that particular location, because, of course, I remember how it was. But I also appreciate the fact that there is still a lot of nice open space in San Diego County that is preserved, that the public can access. And I think that's part of what makes it still a great place to live.

Interviewer: Okay. Well, thank you for your time. It was nice talking to you.

Interviewee: All right. You're welcome. Good luck with your project.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Take care.

Interviewee: And you too. Bye-bye.

Interviewer: Bye.
