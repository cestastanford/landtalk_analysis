Interviewer: Hi. Would you like to introduce yourself?

Stan: Yes. I'm Stan Payzer. And we are going to talk about the Seward Park, which I first encountered in 1977.

Interviewer: Great. So, my first questions for you is, how did this place look before?

Stan: It looked substantially like it does now. It's supposed to be preserved as a natural habitat. There are some changes though, in part due to the preservation. So, when you first enter the park, on your right, you'd see the... before you enter the park proper, the tennis court where all of my children used to play tennis, and they will return again someday. But, in the meantime, they've been ripped up to put in a sewage overflow holding tank. The city has been reprimanded, if not fined, by the EPA for allowing sewage to overflow into Lake Washington, which is the lake that Seward Park is a peninsula of. 

There's been a lot more on development, a lot of population growth in Seattle, and also a lot of newer environmental goals along the way. So, as a perhaps an unintended consequence, the storm sewers are no longer allowed to just flow into the streets, near as I can tell, from new construction and from own house. For at least the last 20 or 30 years, they've been required to capture the water in some way, either in local infiltration tank like we have at our house or by tapping into the storm sewer system. 

And a lot of people have taken advantage of the storm sewer system and saved some money by illegally plugging their toilets and sanitary sewer into the storm sewer system, which caused a bunch of sewage to overflow into the lake when it rains a lot. We think is the population and so the solution is the [inaudible 00:02:20] place where the tennis courts used to be has been ripped up so they can bury a giant underground holding tank to catch the sewage overflow, storm overflow contained sewage. And, so, essentially, it's covered and put the tennis court back again. 

Then, when you get into the park proper, there's a place where I recall, especially during Pow Wow days, which was a sort of pie eating and other country festival during the summer, that there would be a Torii, was a large Japanese welcoming gate. It was a gift from Japan. And it was made of wood, eventually, it rotted away so it had to be taken down as a hazard. And it, too, will eventually reappear after decades. There's a group that's raising the funding to put it up again. 

And if you go into the park, things are substantially the same. There are many miles of trails, at least five total, going through the park and around the perimeter. The view that you see of Seattle from the trails has changed a lot in 40 years. There used to be just the Space Needle, a bank building, and the Smith Tower, which at one time was the tallest skyscraper office building west of the Mississippi, though it was soon eclipsed by San Francisco. And today, it looks more like downtown Manhattan, if you look at Seattle. That's the view from the park. 

Going into the park, the trail system is a lot more organized now as there was more and more traffic, and especially after the Audubon Center opened a facility in the park. A lot of the trails were unofficial at the beginning. Just game trails and trails where people thought this looked interesting so they tromped through, and now there's been a concerted effort to put up maps and actively discourage people from tromping through and blazing their own trails. So it's a lot more organized, but there's less chance to get lost or discover something. 

I've also noticed over the years that the places where we used to, I'm not clear if it's legal, but used to be able to pick blueberries and salmonberries and thimbleberries, are almost all cleaned out immediately now. It's not clear if the bushes are propagating even. Occasionally, there's still the solitary salmonberry or thimbleberry visible. Maybe because people don't recognize them as easily as blueberries. Haven't been in time to see that harvest for a long time. 

There was also a flat meadow where there used to be, especially when the large local Japanese community picking taking [inaudible 00:05:26] mushrooms. And you don't hear about that anymore mostly because it's all been picked out. In contrast with the mushroom nature walks of four years ago versus the ones you go on today. There was an active fish hatchery when I first arrived. And it was putting out hatch salmon for use with local fishermen. But, for whatever reason, they eventually decided that it was not useful.

Interviewer: Interesting.

Stan: Yeah.

Interviewer: So, how would you say the land has changed?

Stan: Well, it's been substantially the same, mostly because it's supposed to be a preserved park. It still has old-growth forest. Some of that has recently, by force, been taken down because a person last year was killed while driving through the park during a wind storm, and a tree fell on their car. So, the city, after a lawsuit, has taken pains to remove any trees that might possibly be a hazard in a wind storm. But, the ones I've seen still be healthy. And especially the ones in isolated areas that they don't expect you to be walking in, are still standing. There are still eagles, and more of them. Since they're protected, they've propagated in the park and increased their population.

Interviewer: Okay.

Stan: And, we've already talked about the fish hatchery and the Torii, and the tennis courts, and all the environmental construction around the sewage overflow.

Interviewer: So, what are some of the things you used to do in the park?

Stan: They're pretty much the same things I still do. I still go for walks, we might even call them hikes in the park. But, fewer of them off the recognized trails because they've actively tried to discourage and remove those in favor the mapped and recommended you must use these specified trails. There's also less opportunity for foraging because the place has probably been over foraged.

Interviewer: Great. That was some super helpful information. Thanks for volunteering to be interviewed for the Land Talks Project.

Stan: My pleasure.
