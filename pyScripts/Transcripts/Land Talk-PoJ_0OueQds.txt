Guy: Hello, this is Guy Kasznik. I am here interviewing my father, Ron Kasznik, for my Land Talk project and this will be actually in the area of the house that I grew up in right inside of Stanford campus. I'll let my father kind of give some of the details about how long he's been here and some of the changes he's noticed in the area. So, hey, dad.

Ron: Hi, Guy.

Guy: First I'll ask, when did you first move here? How long have you lived in the house that I grew up in?

Ron: Sure, so we moved here in 1995, so it's been almost 24 years since we've been on Stanford campus. We lived across the bay at Berkeley for five years before that. So we've kind of been around the Bay Area for nearly 30 years, but more specifically, on Stanford campus in various homes for about 24 years and in the current house for about 18 years.

Guy: Awesome. So this is kind of the big question and we can go from here but, kind of, what are some of the changes you've noticed? Whether it be in the scenery of the landscape, vegetation, whatever you might have noticed around our house over that time. And just feel free to go on from there and maybe I'll ask a few follow-up questions.

Ron: Sure, of course. You know, much of the landscape that you see around homes in our neighborhood are basically landscapes that have been designed by the homeowners. So, you know, that's not necessarily natural vegetation or natural landscape, but you do see several very common themes in the changes we've seen over the past couple of decades in our house and in some of our neighbors' homes. I think one big change that's pretty noticeable is to try to rely on landscape that is not as heavy on water usage. 

When we moved here, almost every house had a big lawn in the front yard. That was kind of almost the default of many homes here. They would build a house and then put a big lawn in front, and what we've noticed over the years is that as homes got renovated, whether through turnover, through new owners, or through remodeling projects, that people have basically replaced their green lawns with more drought resistant plants and that's definitely been a theme. I think most home owners nowadays would not go for new lawn in the front of their house. And definitely it's been the case in our house, although when we moved in, the house did not have a front lawn, but it was an option that was offered to us by the designers. And we already kind of anticipated that the tide was changing towards less water heavy vegetation and so we went with shrubs and other drought resistant plants that don't require that much water.

Guy: Awesome. Would you say you've noticed a change in maybe some of the animals or insects in the area nearby? I remember growing up, I used to see, whether it be squirrels or rabbits, bees, whatever might be, all outside in our backyard kind of running around. Maybe as someone who might have taken more notice to it, I was wondering maybe you can talk a little about how that's changed, if any?

Ron: Sure, there's been a few changes. I think one thing I've noticed is there are some wildlife that wasn't really...that it was rare to see inside the neighborhood. Like deer, rabbits, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, even coyotes and foxes. You'd typically see them if you go out in the more open space, but not so much in the backyards or on the streets of the neighborhood. And I would say over the last 10 years, it's been a big change you see more and more. Whether it's because of changes in vegetation, the open space that kind of drive the wildlife to look for lusher grounds to feed on, maybe development of open spaces kind of crowded out some wildlife. But there are certain types of wildlife that I've not seen here 20 years ago, and I see more common. I've seen coyotes and foxes and I've not seen mountain lions, but I know that they are roaming around. We know that, for example, 10 years ago, we would never have seen rabbits in the backyard. We've seen squirrels but not rabbits and now there's a lot of them. So I think there are some bigger changes in the surrounding areas, and it affects the relocation of some of the wildlife.

Guy: Great, I guess one kind of small question to finish it off, which kind of relates to the more drought resistant planting you mentioned that we installed during renovation. Did you notice the drought having any impacts on maybe some of the areas in the front or backyard that we didn't change or that had been there since we had first moved into the house? Or did maybe the drought have not much of an impact in a more residential setting than it would in just nature or other wildlife environments?

Ron: Well, definitely...excuse me...the last five, six years when there's been a few years with a big drop in precipitation, there's been a big push for cutting on water usage in landscaping. And so I think certainly we've modified the frequency of using water, the amount of time that we let the irrigation system work. And it probably caused some areas that were more dense and more lush before to kind of dry out, it's kind of like the price you pay for that. So, in some way, the vegetation in our backyard has reverted more to being more like natural as opposed to being lush due to artificial usage of water. So in a sense, it's kind of become more what it would have been without us interfering with that.

Guy: Yeah, definitely.

Ron: So in some ways, that might be unintended consequence that we're actually going back to how the place used to look like.

Guy: Very interesting. All right well thank you very much, Dad. I appreciate you taking the time. And thank you for telling us...

Ron: Of course. Of course.

Guy: ...all a little bit about how the environment's changed.

Ron: And good luck with the project.

Guy: Thank you.
