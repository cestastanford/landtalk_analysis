Corinne: So my name's Corrine Thomas. And the location is I guess the Bay area, mostly Stanford and Mountainview, or actually, only Stanford and Mountainview. And how did it look before? Stanford changes every year. It's more built up. Not much comes down, but some things do. The eating clubs at Toyon came down. Maya Library, thankfully, came down. That's really ugly. And they called it ugly, actually. It was undergraduate library, ugly for short.

And what else has changed? I mean there's so much construction around here is always going up, so I won't list everything. But there's certainly many new buildings, the business school, the Roble gym, Arriaga alone. So a lot has changed around here. In Mountainview, there has been more construction too. I mean, now there's Google and Facebook and all the tech. That's really changed. So how did it look before? It just wasn't as built up. There weren't so many people, including students, at Stanford. Other than that, it hasn't really changed that much around here.

Interviewer: Okay. What about in terms of landscape, who lived there apart from that?

Corinne: Not really. I mean, Stanford always has the Stanford look, you know, even when it's Arriaga buildings. So how has it changed? Well, I think I just covered that. Mostly things going up, not many things coming down. So what do we used to do here? We used to not really use much email. We didn't have cell phones, though I had had one before we came in DC. But it was this huge monstrosity that came with almost a little suitcase to it. So everyone used RIM phones. And it's just funny, that world just...the tech world, just changed everything. So that's changed.

Interviewer: And then what about like, if you were to... I don't know, a night on the town in the area or like a day with the family out in the area, what was that like versus now?

Corinne: I would say that that probably hasn't changed much because the theater, that was around 20 years ago is still around. The parks are the same, you know, for kids and things like that. Maybe there are more... Okay, I'll tell you one thing that changed at Stanford, the impacts of dogs' lives is you used to be able to take them up to the Dish. And they won't allow dogs anymore, something about the wildfire. In fact, when we first came to Stanford, there was the annual bonfire for the big game in the middle of Lake Log. And that, they don't allow anymore because of the salamander and other things. So that's a little different on outdoor activities.

Years ago, there used to be a lot more water in Lake Log on a regular basis. That was nice, the size of water in the lake. But other... What do I do now? So some of it is the same. We have resident fellows again. I advise students, still advise Stanford and government. I have a new job in the engineering, in the school of engineering. But that's still working with students, so that's the same too. I don't work in finance anymore. And I wish I gardened more. I still did that then. Yeah, I wish we had more spare time. I think I said that. But what do I now? Resident fellow. I work full time. I advise Stanford and government.

Interviewer: And your free time?

Corinne: Free time? I garden some when I can. I walk the dogs. I try to exercise. I love jazz exercise, but I don't have enough time for it right now. Free time? I love to travel. That's never changed.

Interviewer: Interesting.
