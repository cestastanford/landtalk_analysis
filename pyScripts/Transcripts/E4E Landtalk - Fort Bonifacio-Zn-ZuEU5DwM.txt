30 years ago, I would drive by Fort Anastacio and it was just like the hinterlands, lots of fields and bungalows for the military personnel. Nearby was the American Memorial Cemetery where people would go to pay their respects to the American soldiers who had fallen during the Bataan Death March here in the Philipines. 10 Years ago I would come with my dad and we would fly a kite because it would be very windy, like, lots of open space. No buildings around actually.

And now it is a bustling metropolis, the construction sites and skyscrapers going up. So there are two big malls, three luxury hotels, some condominiums, and office buildings. Traffic is really terrible. There is still a lot to do in terms of city life, restaurants, shopping, and some parks, but it's changed completely in the last 30 years.
