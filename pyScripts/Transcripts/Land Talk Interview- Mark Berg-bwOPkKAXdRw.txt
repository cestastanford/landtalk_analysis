Interviewer: Hi, Dad. What is your name?

Mark: Mark.

Interviewer: And where did you grow up?

Mark: I grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Interviewer: Okay. How did the place look when you were growing up?

Mark: How'd it look? Kind of like New Jersey, but a little more extreme, so lots of trees. It was pretty rural. So we lived kind of out in the country, lots of space between houses and stuff.

Interviewer: What does the place look like now?

Mark: It's pretty much the same, but around the area, things have been more built up, so more like developments and stuff.

Interviewer: What did you use to do there when you were growing up?

Mark: I used to go outside a lot. I would go into the woods and play games. I had a little brother, so we'd hide. We'd, like, pile up sticks and build fires sometimes. We would chop little trees down. We'd run around, stuff like that. Play in the pond. We had a pond.

Interviewer: What do you do there now?

Mark: My mom has moved now to a condo. So now we go and visit and just kind of visit her in her house. She's down the street about four miles away from where I grew up. Then we just kind of go shopping. We hang out and eat, and just visit. Sometimes we'd go hiking. I go hiking still. There's lots of hikes around there. That's always really nice.

Interviewer: Do you think anything has changed significantly, like, weather-wise or anything?

Mark: I don't know. I don't live there anymore so it's kinda hard to tell. I would say, for the most part, things are a little more mild because when I was a kid, I remember things being exceptionally cold. When I grew up and I'd go to the bus stop, my hair would freeze to my head sometimes if it was wet. I would breathe in and, like, the boogers in my nose would freeze. At least it felt like that. It was very cold and now it seems a little more temperate. Although, they have really big storms sometimes that are huge. Couple years ago, they got more snow than they've had in a long time.

Interviewer: Okay. Is there anything you would like to add?

Mark: Nope. That's good.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you very much, Dad.

Mark: You're welcome.
