Well, as you can see from the pictures, the first picture of the barren land was taken while I was standing at the end of our Street. There was nothing there, nothing in sight. The city of Laguna Niguel wasn't there, at least Aliso Viejo wasn't there. If you're familiar with Alicia Parkway, it ended at Moulton Parkway. And so you could see from the pictures of 1983, there was nothing there. Within about probably five years you'll see the new picture, and that's how it evolved into what it is today. At the time, we had three daughters and they used to go down under those dirt lots, ride their bikes, play down there, build things and use it pretty much as more of a playground. Well, unfortunately, when they built all the houses down there, they also put in a very, very nice park. So a lot of people, including myself...go down and walk around the park. There's a lot of houses down there now.
